they literally clapped for him cause he said "i love money!"  ?????  is anyone else confused
The right ideas should supersede politics. Unity. As Americans. As THE Americans; all of us as the U.S. Citizenry. Our power is in our numbers, united - which is what Establishment D.C. fears. So they continue to divide us as they can, they continue to manipulate the People, to control the People. Divided we fall. They understand this very well, dividing to conquer. To control. 
One nation = indivisible. Time to quit listening to their coercive attempts to keep us fearing and hating each other. We are their employers. The United States? It's Ours; not theirs. Legally. Actually. By U.S. Law. They are sent to represent our interests - and they've instead represented only those who pay them well. Deals. Away from the populace. Back room deals. Why do they hate an Outsider arriving, a fellow American, entering D.C. via the same electoral process they went through; the US Vote, into what they consider their home; D.C.? They hate him because they hate you, Citizen. They hold this People - ALL of us - in the highest contempt. We are their easily maneuvered fools. Taxpayers. Donkeys. Ridden hard and put up wet. 
It's time for the People to remember that we run this joint - in unity, and we lose it all, in division. 
Come with a smile and good cheer and you'll be met with similar things, in America. 
Time for us all to step out of the bags they've stuck us in. Together.

TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!

The leftist arguments become increasingly feeble in the face of an America that really is becoming great once again.  Donald Trump 2020.
Somebody get this guy a dodge challenger:

Where is Pelosi? On her way to Gitmo?
@6:39 I love that look on Nancy’s face.  I love her
Paul Ryan looked much better in that chair then Nancy Pelosi does...
Trumps coward little puppets rise and sit so efficiently. And we make fun of North Korea lol
I’m sorry but can you guys remind me when america was great??
Healthy politics involves healthy arguments. I don't see any of it here. Fav quote:
"There can not be peace with investigations"
Sounds like something the venezuelan dictator would say.
Kamala Harris got hurt with her body language.
I must say, Melania has to be one of (if not the most) Beautiful women in the world  !
Schumer looked over at Nancy afraid she might see him clapping for the President,of course she didn't clap,just chewed her false teeth a bit extra, un- real  !
Trump is thieving for Russia ( money laundering )
You have a Great President!! 
I'm just curious, was the President getting his bullet points from a teleprompter or from his memory? If from memory then I am just speechless! You have a genius President. God Bless Him!

Freaking clown
THANK  SO  MUCH  TO  D.  TRUMP,.  MARCO  RUBIO   AND   U.S.A.   BY   YOU  HELP   TO  VENEZUELA   AND  SOLIDARITY   FOR  TRAGEDY  US  COUNTRY.....................!
I LOVE our President Of the United States!  THE BEST WE WILL EVER HAVE. Brilliant man. That GOD has put him in.
Thumbs down just for NBC, not our glorious god emperor, TRUMP 2024!!!!
Democrats want HUGE government because they think that they will somehow have more power than the elite billionaires and those who control from behind the curtain. They are idiots. The only way to move forward is to keep electing people who will reduce the size of the government.
NIKKI HALEY!!! First Female US President!!!!!!
A sorry state of affairs when the Democrat women have to be told that they're allowed to applause when Trump comments about more women in the workplace, party politics in it's finest. To them, it doesnt matter if the thing being said is good  - if they don't like the person who's saying it then it's not worth supporting.
All the controversial tweets aside, this man has done more for America than any of the presidents over the last 20 years (and I am a HUGE Bush fan)
when Trump said that the state of our union is strong, because our people are strong... the left sat in silence.  Is that not something to cheer about???  When he stated Americans will have more money, they looked almost mad... why would they be mad about that???
1 minute in so far is the best spearheaded ever made.
Meet the new boss.... same as the old boss..   all presidents are just puppets.  debt levels are unsustainable.  the federal reserve has inflated an enormous bubble in the economy.  Trump called the stock market a "big fat ugly bubble when he ran for president.  Look it up.  Now he takes credit for the stock market.  he has continued massive government spending like all other presidents.  we are headed for an economic crisis.  don't be fooled.  the federal reserve cannot unwind the balance sheet.  the market was crashing last year with interest rates at just 2 percent.  this is an even worse bubble then 2000 and 2008.  END THE FED.  buy gold and silver to protect your wealth.
Those with the Skowls; are being obviously Treasonous, in attitude, to our country, as below TREASON, is ENEMY. They must work their way up the conditions, so they can seek to rejoin us who want Freedom. They need to go to Cuba and live; as that is the kind of place they apparently want. Like minds, seek like minds. We Americans have always been against Communism and it's sister party Socialism, as it is for the unfree.. Us Americans wants what our PRESIDENT presents to us, our financial Freedom; it is a worthy Goal for us all to seek and support as it will make America GREAT...
I had to literally tape a piece of paper on my screen to block out Nancy Pelosi's disgusting botox ridden face and alzheimer antics behind 
Donald Trump as the President delivered his SOTU.
I don't know if the thumbs down are conservatives down voting because it's NBC or liberals down voting because it was a very good speech.
I'm impressed by how a 72-year-old man can remember 11 A4 paper with so many numbers and names. I don't think my dad can remember anything more than 10 sentences and he just 60-year-old.
I am from California and I LOVE our President and our Forever First Lady!   They have waged war on evil...and MANY of us know it...HRC IS EVIL!!
At least good Ol' Chuck clapped.
Very good!
Why his clap sound so funny though? Lmaoo
1:07 Barron losing hair already?
fuckNBC thats why the thumbs down
From what I can tell the women Demi’s aren’t ready for this position. We expect our student to stay off their cells in school . The people we hire can’t act as well as our kids in school. And we are paying Demi’s  to sit and play with their cells ? Lousy examples. No wonder Demi kids don’t know up from down.
Honestly, the Demi’s sit there like bully’s that are forced to behave themselves. They are an shame to their seat.
The GREATEST PRESIDENT in American History!  WE LOVE President Donald Trump!!
lol I have to right about this for school
trump is daddy asf
I wish the Dem’s never came. They didn’t want to be there so they should of stayed home.
Best president ever 👍🏾👨‍⚖️🇺🇸 TRUE GRITS 🌟
I wish Trump someday would return to judge the living and the dead.
#SOTU
Congress Man Steve Scalise was nearly killed by a Far Left Radical. God Its good to seem him Looking so much more alive. Thanks Trump for Giving the man credit for his dedication to OUR Country.
A leader of a criminal enterprise addresses the entire nation. How strange.
God Bless Donald Trump!
Wade out into the water going to eat fish tonight
I didn't realize Smalls from The Sandlot got to be at the State Of The Union! Wow!
Too much clapping.

As an Australian who never saw your state of the union speeches. Nor did I care to as it’s for Americans. 

Just wanted to see Polosi’s face and how she responded. She has not let me down. That woman is so angry, the secret service should be standing next to her before she attacks someone. Now I know the eyes of Medusa and her twitching mouth chewing back 🤮She is hilarious 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.  

Trump please keep up the speeches and tweets.  Pelosi ‘s clownish antics, its hysterical. Schumer looks like your typical vampire, pretending to be pleasant.  

People around the world are watching Trump because his a great president, who loves his country and all Americans. And we all want one.*
In a couple of days on February 15th when he shuts down the government again and the millions and millions of hard-working Americans Mexicans blacks and whites won't be getting their paychecks because he didn't get his way with the wall which is never going to happen by the way, win all that happens again February 15th I'm going to laugh at all you Trump supporters and all you believers that believed his lies  again dumbasses!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😃🤣🤣🤣
claping every 20 seconds lol did they learnt that from kim
Excited for tonight! #MAGA
The J in Donald J. Trump stands for genius.
Thank you trump for your service
Thank God for our honest President .   The democrat administrators will destroy the strength of American people if they are left to run their socialist agenda .
God i hope he doesn't clap in front of his mic tomorrow's state of the union address so annoying 😩 👎
How come Nancy the crypt keeper  Pelosi's dentures seem to be shifting???
I love to see the mongrel Pelosi licking her mouth from the her last meal.
Boy , I  didn't  see that one coming.... Trump flipped on his best friend  Kim Jung Un ...
They were in love just weeks ago !
Am a Kenyan but I think you have a great president.
I hate you Paul Ryan, you traitor.
Best state of the Union address I've ever seen
1:08 She looks SO happy.
I difn't know that feces had so many different flavors!
Lock her up
Great speech
What A JOKE
The Democrats look so pathetic over there, they look so pathetic it's pathetic, how pathetic!!!

All these great things he has done for the American people black and white, Chinese, Japanese, Korean etc. and the Democrats can't be happy about that really
Chuck and Nancy sitting all smug and entitled. They dont care about the people as individuals they care more for their party.
This state of the union was just another “I’m so great” speech. Pathetic and unmoving. Watch Obama’s speech (or any other President’s thereof) — and anyone with a literacy above a 6 year old child would be able to appreciate the strength in well-placed words.
You see this is why President Trump, is the best President, and the first President in a long time to work for the common man, they working man. And this why he will be re-elected, because he does what he promises to do. President Trump is not a politician, he is a business man, and realizes, not only does have to help the common American citizens, but realized that running America is a big corporation. Which he is a excellent business man. That, and his homeland security, and bring the American middle class back is why he will go down as a great President, thank you President Trump, God Bless You my Friend.
AMERICA FOR AMERICANS!
Trump is a commie. And should charged w/  treason.  And you? You’re a commie lover.  You’re  next.   Commies.
GUANTANAMO...SEND ALL THE DEM AND CONSERVATIVE TRATORS ON THEIR WAY!!
HE MAKES OBAMA LOOK LIKE  ONE OF THE BIGGEST LIARS THAT EVER LIVED.AND HE CONTINUES TO LOOK LIKE A LIAR MORE AND MORE .I DIDNT THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE.
THE DEMS ARE DONE STEALING FROM US AND PRETENDING THEY ARE HELPING US..
Love you man !
What! Black people are getting jobs? I was told that Trump was a recast, this is getting very confusing.
NBC NEWS ARE A BUNCH OF COMMIE FAGGITS
hey, sanction, a.i., regulate, bann, outlaw. hanson robotics in hong kong, hey, a tyrant!
I listened to some of this on the radio driving back from an evening class I take.    I can't believe how the hispanics and blacks in the crowd weren't happy with the unemployment figures.  They have frowns on their faces like an evil figure is speaking.
Great, Dems now can report on San Juan. How about filing FEC docs. 39 Congress People that should and must recuse from any of the 109 Lobbyists Bills or investigations concerning these Lobbyists. Where’s the transcripts. You want Putin/Trump docs. Set an example. Report the gifts. NBC should report on this.
Look at how happy Sen. Cruz was when he got up
Taking back America so it can be great again is all that we want . Thank you POTUS for not being a limp wristed coward.
This whole border wall has been presented quite well from Trump.  There are an undeniable amount of roadblocks always being created in Washington for no reason.
I currently have Kentucky fried chicken and Pepsi beside me as I watch this. XD

It’s what Trump senpai would want.
left media spin and DemonRats are the enemy of American people!!! 😤😤😤😤😤
It's wild to see how aggressively the russian trolls and bots are trying to pretend that Americans like this fraud of a president.
You protect the people on the inside
I liked trump before
But now it's an honor to be alive during this guys time in charge
State of the "Union" lol
A great President <3 Trump.
He has done a very good job so far...

Bravo, Mr. President. Well done, sir.
Great speech!!!
Watching Senator Manchin clap was very refreshing
He looks like he did when he was young, strong eye contact, I think that is the real man you just saw
"America has always stood for freedom" - America is a sadistic superpower that goes around starting wars and has killed 11 million innocent people in said wars.
Great speech, great policy, a shift in U.S. policy that can make America Great again
So articulate when he’s reading a speech off the Teleprompter
Always see this pouting from both sides. Stop acting like children
SAB MADAR==== HAIN
VP Pence is so proud of Donald!
One can CLEARLY see the demonRATS are TRAITORS to their country and even worse, to their PEOPLE!
Shame on you, you worthless scum! Hope you NEVER get back into power again. Leave that country [I'm from the UK]
and take your lying FAKE NEWS friends with you. You have divided AMerica with your lies and hateful rhetoric.
You are NOT worthy to hold office [except one or two decent one's].
Its so easy to elevate citizens' quality of life when you eradicate the massive corruption in DC and globally. TRUMP!! WWG1WGA!!!
Watch Pelosi....big riff in DNR because they've asked Pelosi to step down as Speaker and she refuses to step down!
DEMS could not even stand or clap to"IN GOD WE TRUST"!
I LOVE MY PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP!   #MAGA

Mr president. I hope u listen to the real Media and Public comment. My advise to you is:  1. Read about past presidents. Study them.  2. Study how the W/H functions- protocols, norms, Policies and Procedures.  3. Stop blaming others. Admit mistakes, respect your predecessors, gov officials, cabinet members ..etc 4. The Presidency is the highest Office in the world with a big power attached. Don’t be petty that would belittle the Office and yourself. Earn respect because you can never ever command respect. 5. Don’t crave for recognition you can earn it if you have a good mastery of the function of the president. To master the job, Read, Read and Read! Ask others and learn, learn and learn!  6. Spend you time wisely among others Read and update your self. Don’t be impulsive and unglued. Listen a lot and talk only when important. Don’t make decisions with raw emotions.  Above all don’t forget your job now is not a reality job. It is a real job.  7. Always be honest and prompt the culture of truth and honesty. No lies even white lies allowed.  8. Never allow members of your family to be involved in gov related official functions. This will inevitably creates actual or potential nepotism,  and a serious corruptions.
The baby is freaking awesome
To Democratic voter your party booed or just growned at low drug prices, they groaned at lower healthcare prices while not 1 dem voted for tax cuts r u alive awake serious?
I will never vote for Trump b/c gun control to me is more important than the economy and any other policies that’s going to benefit me... I STAND WITH ALL THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO DIED CAUSE OF GUNS...
I think Trump is going to be one of the best and bravest Presidents we've ever had. I believed from day one he was committed to the things he wanted to do to better our country for ALL of our citizens. I personally feel proud of his plan and I don't care what anybody thinks or says. Great to have somebody with the courage and commitment.
I was heading for bankruptcy. Trump has saved my life by shredding my tax
Did you get your teeth fixed?

I BELIEVE IN VARIOUS TYPE .LIFE FOUND YOUR PERSONALTY .PPERFECT PERPECTIVES THE AMERICAN OF THE LIFE.I LIKE...YEAH
What despicable pulling of emotional strings .  One of many things that stood out was his exploitation of two families whose children were murdered .  Trump is the lowest of the low.
This trump regime is out to push us back to 1900.  Our children will be forced to work in dangerous factory sweatshops, 15 cents an hour, 7 days a week .  you idiots believe his tax cuts for the super wealthy is going to create jobs in the US? .  you fools, they are going to keep investing in foreign sweatshops .  or maybe you want 30 cents per hour ? no safety, no insurance, average life span of 49 years for working and middle class,  etc ?
One hour with a plug in the ear! GOOD JOB!
Trump el mejor Presidente de los Estados Unidos en la actualidad.

They wrote him a decent speech finally.
We should have the same policy as the great liberal country of South Africa. Only do business with companies that follow the example of the Black empowerment policy here in the United States. (Cry for SA and Rhodesia).
Great U.S.
President Trump is 10 times the President Obama was. Finally, we have a qualified leader after 8 years of Obama's failed policies.

Waste of time standing up every 10 words. So many applauses for so called heroes. In my eyes a parent who works 40-60 hours a week just to pay bills and feed the kids without ever giving up is a hero. Recognie those american dreamers!
Now this is PRESIDENTIAL!!!!  Unlike the the former sleaze OBLOWJOB who couldn't stop patting himself on the back through hundreds of "I did this" and "I did that" and totally forgetting he couldn't do squat if it weren't for the American people.
Starts at,
Are people really paying attention to what he's saying? Pay close attention and you'll realize there are a few unnecessary stuff hes talking about also he reading like a 5th grader lol
I've noticed a difference these people stand and clap alot. Tf? Never seen that happen like that.
President SHITHOLE will deliver his first SHITHOLE speech on Tuesday, January 30, 2018, at 9 pm. This won’t be his first SHITHOLE address before Congress — he made one last year shortly after his SHITHOLE inauguration. But it is the first  SHITHOLE speech from America’s first former reality TV SHITHOLE.
Praise Mr. Cheeto Benito!
heiheihei
how can the US economy be so great when we have more debt than we did prior to the 08 crisis? I’m not just talking government debt, but consumer and corporate debt. Usually if the economy is improving and you become wealthier, you pay down your debt. Financial conditions improve, not the other way around
America unknowingly worships the devil. 
That is all.
What does everyone here think about a flat tax rate?
Not qualified to be president
Great speech. TRUMP/PENCE 2020.
The most arrogant & naive president ever!.
That is the most depressed woman on Earth.
Pigs go home
Such a conservative speech, BUT IT WAS PUT OUT BY ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL CHANNELS!
Democrats have become almost like supervillains.
I love trump the best President ever and some of those democrats sure be fired there an insult to this great country.shame on them.
You take this speech and reverse it and you get Jerry Brown, please President Trump help California from Browns dictatorship
Used car salesman, with a weird hair cut.
Pelosi is holding in an explosive fart... She looks so uncomfortable!!
Why didn't half the democrats stand up and claps for blacks and Mexicans getting more jobs and higher wages? Aren't they happy for us? They stood and clapped for the marines. And a few other topics, but not for us pocs???
MAGA
dems voter base is gone  , dem party is over as we know it, no more illegal voters, its time to wake up and join the american party and stop self serving , join the great republic
*M A G E S T I C   C H A M B E R.*
look at all the dems playing on the phone , what a shame, wonder if anything good could be seen on the screen
Nancy looks like some one placed a cat turd in her sandwich
look at ryan look at trump like hes smitten
https://youtu.be/ezKquSrTAUg
He finished a tweet by saying “America is a disgrace”.......................No you ARE the disgrace.
The amount of false facts he spit out is ridiculous and I cannot believe people are buying it smh
Exactly what has he done that has benefited people living in the U.S.
He said there will be a reduction on prescriptions. Thanks to him my insulin, through the obama years, was $800 a month; now its $20 every 3 months. THANK YOU Mr. President!!!!!!!!!!
heh heh dunno why you thought I was young...
So, the market COLLAPSED today. This guy took credit for its growth, will he own this severe drop as his own? Probably not. He engineers anything good, but ducks and hides any time things go wrong. Maybe this has to do with the wall not being up yet. Or perhaps it's due to the "witch hunt" into obstruction and/or collusion. I can't wait to hear this story!
I swear the Democrats got EVEN SADDER when he mentioned the unemployment rate for minorities...you have to at least be happy for THAT guys, I thought helping minorities was your thing, lol.
Doesn't matter if you voted for Trump or not and it doesn't matter of you like him or not. You have to agree with he's ideas and points in the speech. Trump destroyed the Democrates and made them and Obama's legacy look bad.
Clean Coal = Dirty Atmosphere but hey I'm suicidal anyway so idc anymore
Trump looks asian
Yup traders.  Oh sorry I was remember how Republicans acted at the last SOTU.
OMG those poor parents losing their girls and dem's wouldn't even stand for the parents of these two slain girls WTF.
Trump has only pass the Tax Bill, but other than that, he has not fulfilled his promises. He really hasn't done anything else of great importance.   He has had one scandal after another.  I am not impressed with this president at all.  I has been disappointing.  I have only seen division within our country.  Look at the comments listed here and all you see is division.  That is very sad and I hope our country recovers.
All the dem's just sitting hating life, smdh. Get a grip, his wins are wins for all of us but you would all rather see us taxed to bankruptcy.  Disgusting.
Pelosi you can't even clap at working together, you are in the wrong position and need to just quit and let someone with some real drive to better our country fill your sad little place.
The clam before the storm. Don't go to sleep just yet..
Followed by a 5 day downturn
Thank YOU Mr. President!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Traitor!
LMAO THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT COREY THE WELDER
Can't wait until real progressives take over the democratic party and start taking on the establishment. Then everybody will see real leftists
Enjoy your lack of net neutrality 😂😂😂
President of United States of Israel and Dictator of the Free World.
Trumps being used by the Lord God to bring down the deep state and expose the evil. 
#thesecondrevolutionhasbegun
The speech was great. But for the first time, we got a president that means what he says.
35:33 that moment when you weren't ready for the camera
17k dislikes against the american flag, patriotism, american everyday heroes and black people record jobs.
Best SOTU I've lived through.
Anybody see the Congressional Democrats in the audience playing video games and texting people on their I-phones while President Trump was giving this speech?     

The Democratic Party is self-destructing on all levels.  I love every second of it.

Boss.
They all have really nice ties
Trump has the lowest approval rating of any president ever. But I dont see that from these comments. Literally every comment I see, it’s all positive and some hoping he’d run for re-election. It’s just an interesting observation I’m pointing out.
too much hate,  Appreciate
listening to his voice hurts my ears. and my head. and my whole body.
Funny that Trump may be unpopular, but the US happiness level was ranked as 13th in the world in 2016 and in 2017 it moved to the 11th happiest country in the world. Looks as though the one that dislikes Trump are too stupid to know why they are happy.
2x speed :^)
Wow mega great trump the best in history
Bravo the best President in history
MAGA!!!
Beautiful
Clap for da queen
I remember being so afraid that Donald Trump would be our president back in 2016, but I am pleased to report that my opinions on the president have changed. I still may not agree with everything he says, but he is doing a wonderful job as president. This was a wonderful, patriotic speech, and I am confident that the United States will have many more prosperous years to come. God bless the USA, Donald Trump, and everyone.
My 401k has been on steroids, thanks to Trump, and my taxes are lower.
Big money, better national security, stronger economy, and genuine love for our country -- he's definitely my favorite president, so far.
Yes for AMERICANS!!
Best presidential speech since the movie Independence Day
Bravo Trump  !!!

Bravo Trump  !!!                                          2020 is your TRUMP  !!

The True Patriots are back in The Oval Office & America loves it  !
He says "Our nation has lost its wealth but we're getting it back so fast." wait a minute whats our nations budget deficit again? Oh whats that we're trillions of dollars in debt? yeah we are getting our wealth back soooooooo faast
IN GOD WE TRUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good speech!!!!
32:35
I see the Democrats still want to continue their sycophantic, glad handing ways to everyone OUTSIDE of the United States.   Great representatives for our people you guys.  👍
I attended a vocational school and it was the best training I have EVER received!!! I would be up for becoming an instructor at one of these schools.
Pro Trump!!!! He is talking and saying real numbers. Things that can be heard and held accountable. Not just some BS sayings and feel good words... REAL NUMBERS that affect ppls lives!!! (For the better)
Do u kno da wae?
I tell all the liberals around me since they didn't vote for himI get the money they save, now all the sudden they are trump supporters!
You wanna see Blue states turn red? This is how it happens.
Guess who is getting 4 more years!
Amazing!!
It's astonishing how many "facts" are blatantly wrong in this 
state of the Union.
Awesome.  Snowflakes are now an endangered species.  Flee to California, New York, or Illinois you little fragile ones.  You can have those states.
Democrats are too busy continuing their year-long tantrum over losing the 2016 election to bother with trying to unite.  Divide and pout is what dems do best.
That's my president.  GO TRUMP !!!
P.s. at "least Trump will go down as a President  "(and better one) #atworstPresidenteverObama
Demoncrats haven't been this angry since a Republican President saw to it slavery was abolished....and yea I'm gonna thumbs up this too !!
What really makes me mad is the demoncrats not even standing for things that are good for all americans.  They can't even bring themselves to recognize good things for all if they came from trump.
look dem or reb if you cant get behind America then u are for no baorders which by the way every country in the rest of the world enforces then go to one of those country
Thank you President Trump.

Republicans looks like they are pumped and ready to work for a better USA. Thank you! 
🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Democrats looks like sour lemon. They should be ashamed for not respecting. No wonder the younger kids act up. As these grown adults are setting a bad example for the kids.
🍋 🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
Nancy looks like she's trying to get my pubics out of her teeth
democratic L0$ers !!! F Them , Republican Power 4 Ever , WP , WE WIN !!!!! ;D
Great $peech , Trump Power , Trump Rule$ !!!!! ;D WE Love Trump !! ;)
Go to 13:03
Lowest unemployment, keeping illegals out, honors veterans and other heroes, increased wages for all, decrease taxes, create jobs, crack down on gang violence, helping poor people to get on their feet and contribute to society, driving down prices of medications, who wouldn’t want cheaper meds?? And on and on
Dang, I did not vote Trump, but will next election
The worst thing to happen to America since the other Great Depression!!
58:53 another awesome and awkward time.
Watch at 1.25 speed. Helps Trump's slow cadence.
Not a bad speech coming from a Moderate Independent..
@7:48 I just love the look on their faces, just pure shade side-eying. I love that they're wearing the Ghanaian kente cloth to show their pride and stand up to this subpar human, his trash admin, and their hateful, homophobic and bigoted "policies." (Sorry most you had to be in the same room with that troll.)
wow, great speech.
lol these russian bot comments
I’m only here cuz of my teacher :)
His policies don't seem bad at all for the future
just for a minute put beliefs aside. This was an amazing speech! and he was very well mannered
He straight up liar. Give it time he will prove me right people. I’m calling it he is gonna show his true colors and be a traitor watch. I Don’t hate him personally or professionally. He has done nothing for this country and he never will.
Our generation's Ronald Reagan
What's clean coal?
THIS IS MY PRESIDENT! Beautiful speech! The working person's president !
my god i love to hear the man speak
80 minutes, 33 seconds...flawless.
The President tells of good things and prosperity for America. The Leftists look completely miserable. 'Very telling.
if you want a trump narrative, this speech is not it, go read his tweets
MAGA
Goosebumps. My tears are flowing.
his hair color has change a bit...
Flip you
Donald Trump is one of the world class amazing perfect leaders.
Many korean people support Donald Trump's speech.
I'm korean and live in Seoul.
I absolutely support Donald Trump's actions and his words.
I look forward to removing rubbish Kim Jong-un and nuclear missile.
Kim Jong-un is a devil.

God Bless Trump & U.S.A.
from South Korea
I am so proud of what he's doing in our country! I really don't know how there are so many dislikes on this video. This speech is incredible! I am a Christian conservative
God you make me proud Mr President, Hooyah CIC, Hooyah. God Bless the USA
Potus has really seen the real situation in america..... what great big change for the coming years,,,
what exactly did the democrats  not like about what our presidents speech?
that is a legitimate question.
Democrats are not getting the white house for a long time. They are bitter, arrogant and entitled little brats. Still focused on an election that was over a year ago.
I wonder how many people sitting down are NWO Puppets?
31:28, epitome of awkward pause.
Unbiased question, should people clap for themselves as people clap for them?
Makes me soooo proud to be an American....finally!
39:41  
swastika confirmed
We need the Lord Jesus Christ back in this nation God bless us all
lots of sour grapes there, and in the comments too
This POTUS loves America and Americans❣️💯🙏🏽🤩
Respect ✊ our country, AMEN❣️
He is there for us . the people . God bless you Trump!
I’m late in watching the SOTU. Wow! That was THE BEST and most caring and PATRIOTIC address I have ever heard, besides of course our late great President Ronald Reagan. President Trump cares so deeply for our Country, the people, the welfare of our citizens and our great Military and our God. God Bless you and your family President Trump and May God Bless you and VP Mike Pence to keep our country safe and make our country thrive. May God Bless this United States of America! Keep up the wonderful job you have been doing and Making America Great Again!
finally a president who is actually doing something for all americans who want to help themselves & not depend on a corrupt government who keeps them in bondage while they get rich...truth hurts but is neccessary ... thank GOD for president trump & GOD bless america!
https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4351026/clinton-1995-immigration-sotu
Clinton, 1995, immigration, SOTU
Bill Clinton talking about immigration in the 1995
Great speech ! He is enjoying cleaning up the mess barry and his husband left . GOD speed President Trump and your beautiful family !
maga
I love my this man! He's my hero and he's our hero!!!! Trump2020!!!!!
Anyone who doesn’t agree with his speech is anti- American and should have their citizenship stripped then deported to an enemy country.
Hey if these claims are all factual and accurate, I personally have no problem with Trump.
President Trump ,You are an inspiration to the world and has given us new hope.Thank you and God bless you and America.
Hmmm? 🤔 Reciprocal.
This is not my president not a man of honor he's going to run this country straight in to war and the ground. Remember in november   vote blue  to keep trump and his yes man in check.
Dems are a walking talking pack of rectums who can't stand the fact that Trump won and they lost and are still losing
so, the one that who divided even his own people, because of his skin is red so his is the greatest president? you guys are sick in your head
because his skin is red so he is the greatest president? president Obama who was trembling the whole World. 200 countries felt for Obama . President Obama bring the whole World back to America he wasn't great
the 1.8 millions immigrant Trump is talking about " the Democrat save them from deportation.
not Trump
if it's for Trump or Republicans congress they will be gone by now"
that 1.8 immigrant he said he will pass to citizenship" they are the one dreamers he was going forcefully to remove them from This United States"
and Democrat oppose that from happening"
his speech writer prepared him and formed him what to say how to present himself guys" come on " what you guys cannot get there?
Trump ordered to deport all of the dreamers and immigrant" and then now his talking about people from all rock of lives" really?
This is way snake is" when snake wants to eat you" he put his head in the whole" Trump about to be impeach about all of his action" people teach him how to talk that he can get heart of the real American people" what you guys cannot understand there?
I was so disgusted by the things I saw and heard in political speeches given in the last decade (too young to have paid much mind before that) that I was just done with paying any mind to any of it. This is the first time I've enjoyed and fully watched a speech of this nature. I feel so proud and hopeful for America for the first time in years. It's uplifting to finally see a President in power who truly loves our beautiful country and has America and her people's best interest at heart. It'd rejuvenated my patriotic spirit and my love for my country. Thank you and God Bless you President Trump.
Excellent speech and great job of working the room, as always. Seeing all the demtards hard browing him makes this my favorite SOTUA of all time.
Donald Trumps policies will lead to a recession.
Great president !
First of all, I have to say EFF U, MSN, CNBC, CNN, TURNER BROADCASTING, & all local news who put POTUS down. YOU are all devisive & He will remain & prevail. I want him or another like him, here forever. Take that to your corrupt entities. The American People should never be in the dark. We pay these creeps.
So glad that he was put as a cheeto puff in the back of our planners with all the other presidents
21k Vs 17k. The President wins once again.
"Opama care" 12:51
steny hoyer sitting next to nancy brainless pelosi, they need to go away forever.they do no good, for anyone.
This speech makes me cry with a deep sense of joy, that someone hears our plea. God bless our president and country.
Democrats say a lot when they can't stand for in God we trust. Hispanics for Trump!! Let's go. Democrats are liars and racist . Dang the Dems wouldn't even stand for the dude with the crutches. Straight haters .
Thank you God I am American
this north Korean man is amazing God Bless Him
Love Trump, but Paul Ryan couldn't shave before the State of the Union Address.  Come on.....
Welcome to America. If you have an opinion, you're wrong. Lol
He states exactly what I feel.
My President!  Thank you for caring about America.
did this dude really just say that no matter where you come from if you work hard your dreams can come true?? this is the same guy who is blocking immigrants right
Liberals are so evil. Resist this president at all cost and do what isn't best for America so pathetic
It's sad to watch those sour democratic faces in the crowd who won't stand and who are so angry with Trump's successes towards American wealth, freedom, safety, and prosperity.
I am sorry........but regardless who you voted for.........Democrats sitting there looking like fools
Democrats on Alex Jones: Wow, what a ridiculous conspiracy theorist - he believes that there are chemicals in the water with no evidence!

Democrats on Trump: OMG TRUMP IS A HAXXOR COLLABORATING WITH THE KGB WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON YOUTUBE BOTS WOWOWOWOWOWOW  HE IS GOING TO SEND PEOPLE TO GULAGS WATCH OUT HE SECRETLY HAS PLANS TO GENOCIDE MEXICANS WOWOWOWOWOWOW. WE ARE SCREWED BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS ARE PUPPETING US WE NEED TO LAUNCH NUKES ON RUSSIA WHO'S WITH ME?
Nancy Pelosi can't take it lol
Please let the feds take over the BQE project. Skanska is screwing nyc hard
Funny to see the idiots voted for this fool, leaving comments. You're CLUELESS!
Who on earth dislikes this video. Some people are so used to losing they don't know what winning is. smh!
President Trump is Awesome!  He is what this country has needed- A voice for the people.  Those Democrats need to resign, THEY ARE THE PROBLEM!  You can see it in their faces and body language.
Small trucking bussiness are suffering now because the eld...it's killing trucking..he must do something..when a box telling you ..now you go to sleep,and is noon..that will not work..the machine tell them what to do ,what will you call that!!!it's killing of truckers.fix it!!!
wow to be mentioned by the president such an honor during a state of the union.
What an embarrassment - the rich and powerful will eat their just deserts -sooner than they expect
Talk about Three Stooges..
These guys make Mo, Larry and Curly seem like geniuses.
Merica
Boooo
There are nearly 550 terrorists right there in that room. Yes, Trumpie, they should be locked in Gtmo.
If what he is saying is true. Then yes! Yes making America great again. I'm all behind him. But let's fact check. Because if it's not. Then it's also fake news. It has to go both ways. And by the way. Hillary. Go away.
Pretty good speech, My only thing is that Americans and Republicans are going to act like Obama waasn't trying to do the same thing with prison reforms.
Division begins at the top.. When the Idiots at the top who complain about division in this country fold their arms and act like someone crapped in their cereal. That is real division. Don't blame the person speaking. Blame yourself... The real idiots are the ones who sit there with no solutions and only complain about things and not bring anything to the table. All they want to do is defy everything and offer nothing.
I got 34 dollars as a tax cut. I was very impressed. Lol lol lol lol lol lol Trump!! Thats his tax cut bonus. Ill probably have to repay it next tax season. And his speech sounds good... Who wrote it? I'm surprised he was able to memorize it
ALL AMERICANS?! YOU'RE  SO FUNNY MR. TRUMP
Sung-ho is freaking incredible
Fam, think about this for a minute.White America was so bewitched, bothered, and bewildered that a black person was elected president that in retaliation, they elected the absolute *least* qualified white candidate they could find in order to perpetuate the myth of white superiority via “The worst among us is capable of doing better than the best among you.”And ol’ boy finna ruin the country for poor white people while stroking their insatiable egos. “You poor and bout to get poorer, but at least you’re not black!”Talk about cutting one’s nose to spite one’s face!Destruction and self-destruction in the face impending equity are two of the strongest pathologies of white supremacy.
Very well said finally a President for America like how you said we often and really liked keeping our religious beliefs safe great speech
All these black people not clapping LMFAO
Love him!!
Neil Gorsuch looked like he wanted to puke 🤮.
We are going to make even more efficient nukes, but other countries can't have nukes to defend against us? This isn't morally sound.
#GodBlessTrumpAndTheUSA
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
What will he do to help those on social security,the many years they went without increase on their income.  They worked hard all their life ,to be able to spend the rest of their life without worrying how they were going to make it from month to month. They’re the ones who really hurt, and  doing without a decent retirement. I like this president and respect him, but these need better support.
This is what happens when we elect a businessman as President.






Why didn't we do this sooner?
God bless Donald Trump, what a great President and a fantastic man. He stands up for the American people unlike obomber or that trash wanna be president hitlery clinton.
15:15 girl on the left IG?
Trump will go down in history as one of the greatest presidents ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nobody screamed "you lie", im disappointed
Thanks Mr Trump
How sad....an embarrassment to our country and the office of president----a serial liar, an undeniable bigot and a racist to boot.  All of his supports either are the same or they have just been living under a rock for the past 12 months.....a previous commentator said it best, it's like a bunch of lemmings following each other over a cliff!!!!  What morons........
God bless america
Lowest unemployment level for African Americans in US history.... the Black democrats in the house dont applaud? Somebody school me please.
I’m a Republican who didn’t vote for Trump, but I think it’s hilarious how immature the Democrats truly are. Sitting there like spoiled brats who didn’t get what they wanted. Ridiculous. And some of those Dem senators look like they belong in a nursing home.
There were 30 delegates from Delaware who "ratified"  their membership in the United States at a time when there were over 50,000 people living there who never had a say about it, the other states were similar in participation, less than 1 person in 1000 had a say about it.  Only 1.3 % of the people the liars of the day called citizens voted in the first US Presidential election, let alone the people they did not count. The  Shay's rebellion, the Whiskey rebellion ad on and on proves that Trump is just another elite criminal LIAR!   That is why these excuses of humans shouting USA USA USA starting around 1:17:10 are no better than Nazis. Shame on them.
I don't like Trump, but this speech is outstanding. He's doing great things
I didnt vote for him in 2016, but i definitely will be in 2020.
I am saddened by the division between Democrats and Republicans. They should be united. After all they work for the people of America. Democrats acted blatantly childish at this State of the Union. What the President wants should be echoed to all. I feel he is for the people, I see not only the statements made but they are followed much of the time by action. Very different than past Commander & Chief's. If this keeps up, the people, need Democrat intervention with the President. This country is not about government; this country is about the people of this country.
21:16, the pledge of allegiance. Is he referring to the same pledge of allegiance were not allowed to say in schools anymore?
Finally a president I don't need to call by their first name. Donald is Mr. President.
He is nothing but a selfish man 
God will not bless you
He talks a real good game lol I understand how some support him if they don't understand economics lol or maybe they just like him as a person *shrugs* who knows lol
Party aside.  Gather your news, listen objectively, thinks for yourself, and be rational. Don't just play sides for party's sake, that just makes your statements invalid and frankly, dumb.
MAGA! Make America (watch Trump play) Golf Again, at 3 million dollars a weekend most of it going to his companies.
greatest hyperboles in American history
I want any president to be:
-Well spoken
-A good "ambassador"/ representative of ALL American people, respected by the world
-Someone who knows his/ her stuff, history, economics, policy
-Someone who can separate themselves from religion, but not morality or values
-A person who considers things objectively, realizes all the facts, can discern facts from fiction, and make the best decisions for the country, however divided, because the right thing to do isn't always the easiest.
(...and more, but that's a lot in itself...)

It must be a daunting job.  I do admit, that I am for some policies and not for others, and that may be against somebody else's moral compass.  However, I am open to opinion, rational thought, and discussion.  Any of us are hardly changeable, but if we want real changes to happen, maybe it starts with our individual selves.

Random American :)
Trump is the man we needed freakin alsome stock market booming like never before Taxes been reduce for the workin people helping our illegal alien problem he's don't more in one year to get this country back on its feet than Obama did in two terms he did nothin but hurt us
Voting for Trump was the best vote we all will have made in our lives!! GO TRUMP!!!!!
Clean Coal = Dry Oceans
Living proof of the hate for America from the liberal dumdocrats
This xenophobic, racist, and anti-immigrant president is against all forms of immigration, legal and illegal period. Why is he proposing to cut by half the number of green cards issued every year to foreigners?? Why is he proposing to reduce dramatically work visas for highly qualified immigrants as well as low skill workers?? Why is he proposing to reduce dramatically the number of humanitarian visas for political refugees and asylum seekers?? Why does he want to end lottery and diversity visas?? Why does he want to end immigrant petitions of U.S. citizens and legal residents for family members abroad??? The First Lady Melania brought nearly her entire family through what he calls chain migration.
Americans love an underdog.  Has there ever been more opposition ,$$$ and power against any single man in US politics? I find it incredible that he is not only weathering the storm, but in-fact beating the storm back into submission.  Incredible.
Can ...he ...talk...any...slower... Zzzzz
“Defending 2nd amendment ...protect religious liberty” i though that was the 1st amendment 🤔
Thank you President Trump for the best SOTU speech in 20 years.
Great speech, founded on actions performed, not actions promised...
I just go my pay stubs and my federal tax deduction has now dropped $130.00 per month!!  I never got this under a Democrat President.  Thank you President Trump!
TRUMP - Taking Russia Up My Pooper
HA HA bagonger
This is Hope and Change....
Democrats are thinking one word.  I'll give you a hint.  It starts with an F.
The Democrats are angry because there isn't a gallery of victims like the Democrats always show us.
THE MANDATE IS GONE.  HALLELUJAH.
Thank you president Trump bring all the companies back!  Making America great again!  I'm so proud to be an American! God Bless the USA!
probably the best state of union speech i have ever heard of. Go Trump!
Pelosi must resign
Best speech ever!
I’m sorry, I thought he said more hero’s like CJ who he can brainwash into getting rid of those who don’t fit the “American Way”
When Democrats can't even stand up when the crowd was chanting "USA!" Who are the real traitors?
Beautiful speech!! Love you President Trump!!! Thank you for honoring our soldier, Otto's parents, and the North Korean refugee. I teared up. God Bless America, President Trump, and the beautiful American people!! Love from a South Korean first generation American!!
notice the Democrats are just sitting there tweeting how unhappy they are to be there lol
President Trump is the best president ever he is for We the People, all people, and anyone that cannot see that needs to really search their heart
Um the entire thing was just full of fluffy words for gullible Americans. >_>
I love that the democrats and lying RINOs have such looks of pain on their faces. It's wonderful. Thank you so much President Trump!
I love this president!!
2 million mexican Dreamers have a chance to be u.s. citizens for the 1st time ever.Lowest unemployment rate ever.He gave the money back to the people,Lowest black,brown, white, yellow unemployment ever.Yes we have a shortage of skilled labor now.So he wants to bring them in the U.S not just by chance slave trading lotto system.The Top 1% 3/4 are who are Democrat.If you give people enough extra money to buy things like cars a lot of them will.If you stop the slave labor from coming across the border pay will have to and is going up.The Democrats forgot one group of people.They include every race cred and color and for the first time in a long time they are growing.I for one think we are way better off and the potus is trying very hard to find middle ground.
Not one democrat stood up for the families of the two girls murdered by illegal alien MS13 gang members. Now we know they don't care one bit about the poor, people of color, and most definitely not Americans.
Lowest unemployment, keep illegals out, honors veterans and other heroes, increase wages, decrease taxes, create jobs, crack down on gang violence, etc...Unless your not just looking for a handout, how can you not love this guy as President?!
If you love him or hate him, America is a much better place then it was under the last Administration....why are Democrats so racist and so anti-american ?!
No more than a foul cannibal king surrounded by the hungry. Will they eat him before he eats them?
Sincerity itself avoids his blatant, grabbing, medical-grade manure
Great speech by a great American President. The only things I hate are the democrats being a bunch of SNOWFLAKES and everybody, Shut TFU, Sit TF Down, and stop clapping until the end. I wonder how short the SOTU would actually be if the clapping was held to the end?
He punishes us for being dumb enough to listen, as if we believe!
Thank you Mr.President
GO TRUMP! The deep state is GOING DOWN!
Has to be one of the best ever speeches, with the best ever ideas and policies, if only it had extended to stopping aid to Israel and making it illegal for anyone with dual nationality / two passports to represent the USA in politics....oh and I almost forgot, there was nothing said about destroying the Federal Reserve, or of even forcing an audit of their reserves.
Sad to see at 55:02, the police officer and his wife receiving commendation, and yet his wife who was breast feeding her baby, felt it necessary to hide herself and child under a poncho type tent!
Welcome to comments. Oh no, what a war zone this will be!
Finally proud to be an America. So happy to have Trump for our President!
I would like to know EXACTLY what it was that "Ashley" did to save 40 people.
God Emperor Trump will make American great again.
Im not American, but that even brought tears to my eyes! I wish we in my country had leaders like you do in yours.
That really was an excellent speech!
The thing about appointing justices to Supreme Court scared me😱.  Other than that everything was beautiful.  Well done Mr. President!
Not particularly one that enjoys long speeches, I put off watching this. But wow, I was taken back, it made me weep at times, the victims, the heroes, the struggle. Trump wasn't my first choice for President, but his track record sure has made me glad he is President today. #MAGA #Trump2020
Irrefutable prove that the Black Caucus stand for NOTHING
Irrefutable prove that the Demtards stand for NOTHING
All white racist privileged nazis need to go down.  Time to elect a Hispanic to lead the resistance!
Kinda silly that clapping took up 1/3 of this whole thing lol
....as President Trump continued to deliver his speech, a small screen lowered behind him and his colleagues.  Suddenly, this began to play on the screen > https://vimeo.com/204113209 followed by complete silence over the room, disdain written all over their faces, until.....the end credits roll and President Trump's hands began a gentle clap, followed by a thunderous applause by his audience.  "America needs more poets like that guy!" he says......and then I woke up.
I will never forget this speech Tank you Mr Trump
Todo brasileiro deveria assistir e se envergonhar de suas escolhas políticas sem base alguma de conhecimento! Nós vivemos numa falsa democracia onde a propaganda é a verdadeira inteligência e os eleitores apenas escolhem aqueles mais bonitos ou os com um discurso mais bonito, mais carismático. Não escolhemos a partir de convicções políticas, o povo do Brasil escolhe seus políticos de olhos fechados, não sabem o que é socialismo, não sabem o que é comunismo. Vivemos numa escravidão onde o estado é o feitor e os grilhões é a ignorância política! Parabéns Donald Trump, parabéns vizinhos americanos, um dia, nós brasileiros, também iremos nos orgulhar de nos chamar americanos. Fé em Deus, que Deus abençoe aos brasileiros e aos americanos. Deus abençoe o Brasil e a América.
Opinions are like butts.. ya'll got them ;)
Such a great president !!!!
this is a very good and nice speach from our presdent, Greetings to you all ,My name is Mrs Lastri,i want you to help me in reaching out to the poor and needy in your country so if you are ready get back to me so that i will give you the full details here is my email(budicares @gmail.com
).Have a nice day and hoping to read from you soon.Yours Mrs Lastri Budi.
Don’t get what’s so bad about the guy seems perfectly fine to me every time I see him every time I turn the news on all I see is negativity
He is s good artirely
He recycles his lies
Why do people whine about prez Trump ? There was two choices him or hillary . America chose the lesser evil . If people are unhappy they should have run for president
The burning hate that Americans have for each other is so rich, it could power a thousand suns. Brings a tear to my eye, it's so beautiful. The self-hate and rage against each other. So much for "United". The rest of the world is laughing at this three-ring circus act
Ill never forget Trump!! He will always be remembered. This is for the record books!! 👍🏻 Love that guy even if he isnt squeaky clean!! Forgiveness and strength!!
EVERYONE stop bullying each other and tearing each other down in the comments. It only hurts, it doesn’t help.
the worst.
Absolutely the best!
Why isn't Hillary in jail yet?
Let the college educated in...keep your poor out???  Seems USA turns out low numbers of college educated?
What about raising the min wages for bartenders and waitsaff...I know we get tips..but that has its highs and lows..can i get my taxes lowered from what's being taken out if my paycheck..bc everything I make an hour equals what I have to give to taxes in my paycheck..
35:45 haha bernie sanders applauds and has an epiphany, maybe Trump is onto something and my socialist views are misguided, oh my god, my lifes work was a waste of time
MAGA🇺🇸
If the economy keeps going like this, more jobs, lower taxes, and less regulations Trump will win again if he runs.
Must be a challenge to sit behind the president for over an hour (supporter or not) and be filmed reacting to his speech.
And when Ginsburg or Kennedy retire, we will get another Supreme Court Justice that doesn't make up new interpretations and meanings to known laws.
Honestly not bad... But just him being illogical and using false information is just not right for a president. But honestly it wasn't as bad as the ratings say. Just need some work on becoming a better president.
❤️
you deserve to be nuked !!!?,,,,😈
I liked the speech... the only thing I didn’t like was the clapping that seemed to last a minute, and happened every other minute.
pelosi looks like she pooped her pants or maybe, god willing, she is having a stroke, her and maxine waters, pocahanus to, screw them all
GO TRUMP GO< notice how the democrats are so  sullen and defeated, stupid bitches
Apple investing $350 Billion and Exxon Mobile to spend $50 Billion in the USA and democrats still sit on their hands.
Democrats sure don't like it when Americans get to keep the money they earn.
TRUMP. IS. GREAT.
Ben Carson is one of the best cabinet members in U.S history.
Unemployment for Hispanics and they do the same thing.
Unemployment among African Americans at the lowest level ever recorded and the democrats stay seated and sit on their hands. That speaks volumes about who they are and what they want.
Yes!
Man those supreme Court judges look like executioners
Wha a great speech by our President Donald Trump, he is such a great president and leader. Thank you Mr.President for all you have done.
GOD BLESS AMERICA
7:17
Look at all the fake trump bots saying this was a great speech. LMFAO
Daym quit clapping into the mic patna
Does anyone feel so distanced from these people? Is if they are a different species...
What a great speech!
I like the like and dislike ratio.
At 8:03 and 8:30, It seems to me that democrats don't want wages rising and unemployment low. They would rather keep people poor and depending on them for handouts.
Funny how Trump is trying to take credit for everything that has progressed... temporary progress. A perfect name for Trump is Blowhard.
Nancy Pelosi looks like she should be Skeletor's wife.
Who is this beautiful man?
Bet the brainwashed watch this not listening to good things but looking for a reason to further extend their hatred toward trump 👀👀
Lets go trump
He sounds a lot better if you play it back at 1.25x speed, he's not the best at giving speeches, but he definitely sounds better like that, more coherent.
Trump did awesome. Obama is out and done and he needa to just go back to his country. He alnost desyroyed this country but he didnt get to finish.  So glad trump is dumping the crap that was forced on us.  I couldn't be a Democrat they have to much of a sour face and i have to smile when good is being spread
You can tell Steve scalise is a wild mofo 😂😂
Sic Semper Tyrannis..
#MAGA and everyday he is MAKING America Great Again. It’s concerning to see all of the liberals dividing this country. Trump is doing AMAZING, do you really hold that much hate in your heart to see him succeed as your president? OUR president.
Liberals will find anything to hate on Trump for. This dude cares more about this country then probably 90% of Americans in general
This is fake news, there is no speech and no one was there
Dis was a badass speech and everyone knows it
"African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded."  Black congresspeople don't clap.  XD  And this is why blacks need to stop voting blue.
What's really sad is seeing all these conservatives in the comment section criticize liberals for hating trump because they are brainwashed by the media. The irony is that they themselves are the ones being brainwashed by conservative media such as Fox and other similar stations
Who else is considered about north Korea nuking California
more than an hour without a script.🙌🏿👍🏿
Trey gowdy in 7 more
His done more than any pres thus far and I'm not into politics like that but it time to wake up people
That's because they think this is a joke....
Look at Donald Trump doing what he promised... #MAGA
Does he say chyna?
I experienced all he is saying. That's why I believe all he is saying is true!
Great president   
Mr.Trump 😍😍😍
I promise He is better then Obama
lol why are people disliking this is nbc not trump
f u die in h ell
Thankful thankful thankful for President Trump. God bless America 🙏🏻🙏🏻
What? Those blacks sitting there all stone faced want to argue with numbers? How ridiculous! The numbers he quoted are able to be seen by anyone who has eyes to see, they just refuse to. This needs to be looked to as a huge split in our country. This isn’t  whites against blacks anymore. I, personally, would like to know what their problem is? Is it because he did it, and they didn’t? Their silence and negative attitudes can only be guessed at when everything Mr. Trump is saying is good news. Those guys and the democrats, look like someone crapped in their Wheaties!
CONGRESS NEEDS TO WORK TOGETHER..ALL OF THEM OR WE THE AMERICAN WILL VOTE YOU OUT!!!
Great speech!!!
Gg
The fact that only one African American clapped when he said "Black unemployment is the lowest that has ever been recorded" is concerning. It's as if they are scared that they might lose all their voting power in 2020.
A wonderful State of the Union address.  I would only hope that there are enough Americans in California who will see to it that the Pelosi woman retired version.  What a despicable presence she portrayed...and as to the young woman’s comment about self aggrandizement by our President, sorry my dear that you so strongly see race here...claiming President Trump’s many accomplishments having ANY connection to your hero obama...nothing could be further from the truth, and that man did more harm to your race than anyone else in the past 200 Years.
Pence....needs eyebrows...😯
Why are there so many dislikes
Trump is awesome. He is doing a very good job and day-by-day exposes the negativity of the left.
Be strong everyone! We've finally got someone for US!
" bla bla America is the greatest country on the planet "YEAh !!! ( Awkward standing ovation )" Blabla American beroes, support the troops and lick the flag "YEAH !!! ( akward standing ovation )" God, family and the police, support the troops, veterans are heroes "YEAH !!! ( awkward standing ovation )" We were always the greatest country, no other country ever had it as hard as us and still, we manage to make it even greater because of our greatness "YEAH !!! ( Awkward standing ovation )
This " show " is quite surreal... Self congratulation at it's peak. Only in America and in banana republics do you see that, oh, wait....
Cool how youtube is making the top comments negative ones despite the positive ones being more liked and commented on.
VERY MOVING.......YOU CAN TELL IT'S NO BS!!!! TRULY MOVING.
GOOD JOB MR. PRESIDENT TRUMP......AWESOME SPEECH.....JUST AWESOME.
Some good cardio for all who attended, sitting down and standing up over and over again.
President Trump is a true Patriot... with great courage !
Very good state of the union address ! My stocks have increased and my small business taxes have went down, exponentially.  More job opportunities in my area as well, I’m thankful for our President,  he’s just starting .....not sure why some Americans are so against our President.  Everyone allowed their opinion, that’s our America way.... I’m glad I’m American.  Many young men and women have gave their lives for our flag and our country.
LMAO The left is grasping at straws at this point. 😂😂 Bunch of hypocrites lmfao
!!!
i like to make comments about stuff on the internet  cuz i think that they make a difference...
- "dozens of countries voted against our sovereign right" : propaganda for morons !  *128* members used their vote as *sovereign* States to express their opinion and position.  Rest of the vote: 35 abstained, 21 did not show up, and only *9 voted against (supporting Trump's Jerusalem stance).*   That is just one example of how the President talks to you, knowing you do not care about the truth behind his moronic statements.  Trump caters to ignorant fools who do not care about the rest of the world.
Not a fan of Trump, but this was a good speach
WHERES OPAMACARE?
Ok who in here actually watch this before going to the comment section? Plz no lying
At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.
God bless President Trump, as a Canadian I can proudly say that I am a Trump supporter!
All the clapping😂
"we were elected to serve the (American) people"....the look on Pelosi's face 😂
The guy has no class
Special Counsel Robert Muller Files in US District Court to suspend the conviction of Mike Flynn due to FBI investigators bias in the case
The idiots just sitting there don’t get it still. They will when it’s election time
I'm not a republican but I'm very very please with this SOTU
God bless you Donald Trump. You are doing more for our nation than the past few decades' worth of presidents, I am extremely proud to call you my Commander in Chief.
Why did the African American congressmen and women not stand and celebrate for the record low unemployment statistics of African Americans? They looked all grumpy and upset...
Funny how Leftists are calling Trump Racists for trying to support immigration laws and not let illegals in...Since when was illegal a race?🤣
I honestly didn't know what I was gonna get by voting for Trump because Clinton was an absolute no-go. I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.

After one year, I see his hands are doing what his mouth said he would do, and I'm just freaking THRILLED we have someone who loves America, and is doing everything he can to correct the horrific damage done to this country by the Democrats (especially The Obama).

And, look at the Dems sitting there scowling! WTF is wrong with them??? Why is Making America Great again such a despicable goal to them? 

Thank you Donald Trump. I see you're doing what you can, and using the "bully pulpit" with great skill. You go Mr. President! MAGA!!!
Woohoo! Finally someone who isn't trying to destroy the military :)
Honestly I am embarrassed to have these dudes represent me as leaders in America. The only folk fooled by these guys are their American supporters other countries are laughing at them.
Amazing speech I cried most of the time those heroes deserve a standing ovation but who to call them out not like the democrats even bother to applause
Trump got 2020 vision. Trump 2020 www.undadirt.com
As a daughter of two Hispanic legal immigrants, I'm proud to call Donald Trump my President.
I think its time to get rid of white national terrorists terrorizing America and then finally America will at last be great again.
President Trump and first lady Melania have brought back dignity and class to the whitehouse......well  compared to the eight years of the grifting freeloaders.
Trump has America's back. He is looking out for us
20:20 What a cool little dude!
YUUUUUUUGE!!!! Lmao love the Don, what a guy
CG PO, you could see on her face.  "That's the job.  Its why we signed up to be in the Coast Guard.  To Save Lives.""

All supporters of illegal immigration need to be charged with aiding and abetting criminals and criminal conspiracy under the RICO Act.

i am latina and i really admire this speech and yes i am an immigrant w usa passport..and citizenship...but this man is doing the right thing..PRAISE GOD FOR HIS ANOINTING ON HIM!..and OBAMA wa a globalist New World Order SELL OUT!..and secret muslim....lier!
"Americans are dreamers too." *wipes tear from eye* Thank God For You, Mr. President. :*)
God bless President Trump and God bless America and its people.
Worst State of the Union Ive ever heard. All about division and war.
"We pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American resolve" ... This means absolutely nothing.
Man i wonder why the Republicans stood for the part where Trump said that blacks and Hispanics have the lowest unemployment rate ever? Maybe Republicans aren't so racist after all. I still don't understand why the Democrats, who are the ones who constantly advocate for minority rights, didn't stand. Maybe they are just using them to be reelected.
Second chance for prison inmates-he is talking about helping criminals not be criminals. Music to my ears.
"The State of our union is strong because our people are strong"

How can you have a problem with that!!!????
Nice to see he's actually coming through with his promises, which also will be more permanent, since he's not just writing executive orders for everything (go figure, he's using our congress to pass legitimate laws?).  I mean, I never watch the news, but the simple things being presented here for all to see and hear, plainly, like changing the rules of engagement, are a huge deal!  Trump is definitely not the best of speakers, but what he's actually doing is far greater than anything any politician has said in many decades.
Mr. President, you have my support now for as long as you are Commander-in-Chief. You are truly a man for the people, all the people.
Fantastic topics.  I appreciate all and agree.  God Bless.
I'm grateful for our President - he's making America great again, putting America 1st - bringing businesses back, taking care of our military, our vets... Lowering taxes, new highs for the stock market, lower unemployment, increased jobs, caring for the poor, and those who have suffered the loss of loved ones, honoring our heroes - Well done. I've prayed for every president we have had over 5 decades, regardless of political affiliation or views - They all have needed our prayers.  I'm proud to be an American - May God Bless America!
My hopes. My dreams.  Is Impeachment!!!!!!!!!!!!
To all you Trump supporters! Do you know that Native Americans can't get deported right!? Now please think about it! 😂😂😂
Trump2020🇺🇸
17k liberals disliked this.
i noticed that when he said that the unemployment rate with African Americans is the lowest its ever been not one black congress or senate member did not applause. you know why they depend on unemployed black voters to keep them in office to keep them on welfare. look at the facts!!!!
🇺🇸
Trump sound more like a democrat should be than the democrats are. UK Love Trump!
Both the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries are plunging together.  This is an ominous sign for a nation completely dependent on borrowed money and cheap imports.  The lack of concern is amazing.
Lot's of russian bots praising trump in the comments. Seriously I expected way more hate for the president here 😂
What a beautiful speech that will be remembered forever
LIAR
Wondering how anyone could watch this and feel all of the emotions of everyone trump praised and all the amazing things he said and give this video a thumbs down. The Democratic Party in this country needs to grow up and admit that Trump is actually doing an amazing job and I’m proud I voted for him. #trump #makeamericagreatagain
HE IS FAKE!!!  WAKE UP PEOPLE!!! 😴😕😮😡
WOW so far very presidential presentation and inspiring.  Sure he terrified me and I did not vote for him or Mrs. Clinton-her history is so patently corrupt she scared me worse, but my opinion has slowly changed as I watched what he could accomplish under constant negative spin by the media for everything .  They never mention anything good and twist everything in ways that are extreme even for them. In fact it was listening to their spin in 2016 that made me scared of him.  I have been shocked by it and this past year has made me think:" hmmm maybe this guy is really a threat to the status quo 'cause they are on him like a pack of rabid dogs".   I am still listening to the speech and still liking it.   I have never had the stomach to listen this long to a State of the Union before.   I am happy to see that he is rising to his office over time.  It is predictable that the media says the tax cuts do not help people like me, but IT SURE DOES !  The unconstitutional individual mandate of the ACA is GONE.  YAY-- that was soooo wrong on so many levels not the least of which was that is FORCED so called free citizens to give their money to RICH FOR PROFIT INSURANCE CORPORATIONS.  I did vote for Pres. Obama the first time he ran, I did not the second time-- he sold us out, so far I will be voting for this president next time.
HE IS FAKE!!!  WAKE UP PEOPLE!!! 😴😕😮😡
HE IS FAKE!!!  WAKE UP PEOPLE!!! 😴😕😮😡

Liberals would find any way to insult a great speech by Donald Trump. "95% of this video has clapping" "#notmypresident" "liar" his speech is about how america is improving economy.
To much applause anyone agree? 👏
Pelosi looks like she forgot to spit after bj.
What up my bots!!!
Crooked Republicans need to quit wrecklessly releasing classified info for political reasons. They are jeprodising  our national security !
I didn't vote for him. I don't care for him. I wish he weren't the president, but this was his best speech ever.

WOOOW trumps own words on #1 on trending this can't be right? not even left biased analysts commenting over it? I AM SHOCKED
Good job.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
18:45,  best thing I’ve heard in years from a president
Can anyone tell me if he said anything good about immigration laws. To lazy to watch orange man talk
Wow, how can some many people dislike this? The Russian bots must be up
I am glad that it was said to give people who have been in Prison a second chance at life to be able to get a job and become employed.
If your a Democ-rat your a communist
I'm more lib than repub, non religious and i honestly love trump so much more than clinton
Crazy to me how many people just believe the stats he flings. Won't even research them for themselves. So quick to believe propaganda. Must be easier than admitting he's a complete dud. 

Even a cursory look at the stats from the last 8 years proves this economy is a continuing trend from obama.  Self aggrandizing at its finest here
Praise be to our lord and savior. All hail God Emperor Trump!
Yea we need 2020 to come fast so this Guy is gone
Good
Trump supporters are beyond inbred
короче гандоны
Alot of cancer from both sides in the comment section
Obviously there are way too many comments worshipping Trump when his approval rating is below 50%, that doesn’t make sense. Literally almost every comment is about how great Trump is, so there must be some bots
Why is it so small? Other news outlets have his speech at like 5 or 6 hours
Surprised the Alt Left stood and clapped
45:23 Cj/Tj just got shown to the whole world lol

absolutely terrible speech
I honestly don't care about the government  anymore. Just like in the past you can't trust what they say. Oh look another speech from Trump that is being used to make him seem like a good guy. It's silly how people fall for this so quick. No wonder other countries make fun of us, we are just people who just like to hear empty promises and lies. Look Trump may of done an impact but it wasn't only him. You can't just magically turn around the economy with 1 year of presidency. He probably doesn't even know what he's saying but reading it off a script. It's just like in movies where people like him make others look like complete idiots.

NWO! New white order intent. Fascistic legal genocide formulated by Cambridge Analytical and its clients is what a small group has been tricked to support, backed by anarchists and hackers to convince you the rest of the country agreed. Only now do you know the power of betrayal...and outed yourselves in history as traitors to our Americans forefathers and its citizens who protect the constitution, not loop hole, bend or break it. It’s just a fact. Stooges and agents got you to betray everything just so they could watch how America deals with hating themselves. They knew the republicans and Dems would all hang themselves fighting ghosts that they thought were each other while raping the country as it stands. Top 1% gained 10x normal wealth gain in 2018. Traitors will let it happen because of pride or because they are thinking they are strengthening the white race. A race fooled to believe they were going instinct. This is gonna be a lifetime of embarrassment done by ones own hand. You let Puerto Rico rot after raping it. Yeah.

Good luck with all that. Not sure there’s any coming back from that. So of course you’re all full steam ahead. 

Cowards.

As an athiest, I feel that not only am I unrepresented, but many other religious and non-religious when it comes to politics, I hear the word "God" thrown around so often as if its something EVERYONE shares in common, oh your american, so your christian. Isnt america supposed to represent freedom? I shouldn't have to feel obligated to join a religion, and neither should any christians feel obligated to bombard me with hateful comments but it will happen, just place a reverend in front of your cause, he will know your right.

Edit: I am a trump supporter I THINK... I do like what hes done so far! Might not agree with the methods, but not bad so far..
This is what I call a president

Good job Mr President keep cleaning house. 
Your changing government!!!!! # did more than any president ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He's so fake!
Hmmm...I'm just not seeing "job training" in the constitution. Maybe if the government just stick to what they're SUPPOSED to do our taxes and national debt would become more manageable.

👏👏👏
Anyone can lower taxes, but it takes a man to lower the deficit.  In this regard Trump is just another Bush, who lowered taxes and then bubbled up the economy via deregulation and government spending, and then will leave office right as it all pops.   The cycle goes on... Except I'll be ready for it this time.
Great job president Donald Trump 👍. Proud to be an American! President Trump 2020!
Democrats Soo butthurt
as a life-long democrat, i was truly embarrassed by the behavior of the democrats during president trump's address.  the DNC has not learned its lesson from the last election.  there will be backlash against democrats for the borderline crazy anti-trump activity.  i didn't vote for trump but he's the president and he's not doing that badly.  he's earned some credibility among my circle of friends who are also democrats.  we're beginning to feel  uncomfortable about associating ourselves with all of the anti-trump democrats.

ohhh ok. So because the speech is good, That means he's a good president!! ohh so thats how it works. so minus the racist comments lack of responsibility to the safety and security of all us. we should all sink to his feet
no people as fearless as americans..i think thats showing favoritism. You can support america without supporting its follies and injustices.due to americas shortsightedness half of europe was under communist control when giving it to stalin against winston churchhill's advice. or putting sadam in charge and opposing him not when he killed  groups in his country but when he attacked usa kuwait oil interests....if THAT is american exceptionalism I dont want to be a part of it.
I dont agree with ending visa lottery what about those people who became us residents just to bring their parents over on a viza and now they wont be able to meanwhile a us citizen born to illegal parents once they're old enough can legalize their parents, who in my opinion they dont deserve that privelage since theyre here illegal. Thats just not fair and wrong. If he truly wants  illegals from coming over why not pass a bill or something for those who qualify to give birth for free? If he were to remove that trust me illegals wouldnt be having over 5 kids and people wouldn't be immigrating here as often. Every job should require ss verification too.
Great speech. Proud to be an American.
For some reason everybody in Trump's side look like they are demons

The fact that African American congressmen wouldn’t stand and clap and the low unemployment in their community is astounding to me. They truly don’t care about this country or the people that they “represent”. President Trump has done an incredible job and exceeded every expectation I had.
Fight on ,Trump, fight on
i would like to hear something on net neutrality though
Trump averaged one false claims every 4.5 minutes of his first state of the union. 
Do your research if you think otherwise
As Taiwanese South African listening to this speech, I must say President Trump makes American feel proud and confident. Many stories he tells touch my heart.
Look at how fast the democrats left after the speech.
If he could act like this all the time, people would like him more
HEADS UP ON THE FAKE ACCOUNTS EVERYONE, LEFT OR RIGHT .
Lol he and his administration just walked in there and said yeah... Let me show you kidos how to run a country
Whether you agree with Trump or think he is the worst President ever. I think we can all agree that the Democrats were acting like children that day.
It must be killing liberals that a president trump video is #1 on trending and has a positive like/dislike ratio
He made garbage assertions as usual
That was so American it turned my parrot into a bald eagle.

The funniest note about this speech is that it's the 3rd longest after 2 of Bill Clintons speeches. And yet it only has 55,000 words, one of the shortest speeches. It's just shows how SLOWWWWW this man reads. hahahaha
:v
WTF!!!!
The American people are strong!
I’m tired of people getting upset about Trump supporting legal immigration over illegal immigration
wow 16k dislikes? they must not have listened to the speech before they disliked it. How could you not have been proud of that speech?
Remember who the real racist are: The Democrats. They didn’t clap for the low African American unemployment rate not for the family who daughters were slaughtered. Republicans did for both!
He won't complete his first term
Unos felicitan , pensando que es lo mejor para Estados Unidos , sin darse cuenta que se están traicionando ellos mismos con dejarse sobornar por Donald Trump , este supuesto "Precidente" esta tomando decisiones incorrectas solo beneficiando su país , y dañando a otros .. solo es mi opinión y me vale verga si no estan de acuerdo
Why are Trump and Ryan wearing blue ties.
Yeah TRUMP!! Build the wall!!!!
Paid positive comments everywhere. Quick like my status to Trump all the good comments with REAL human likes not generated   TRUMP SUCKS !!
This speach was a dissapointment. Why did they hire a speach writer? I was looking forward to an hour of sheer entertainment and listing to our stable genius Drumph-down the SOTU. Very sad. No big laughs. Not the best laughs.
I have to say that I really loved this speech. No divisiveness or scorning of groups or segments of the population; and no negativism. Only optimism, and it's about time. We've had enough scorn, and enough gloom and doom.
Why do democrats hate American so much?
Can’t decide if I liked the speech more or watching the Dems ruin themselves with their responses.
How many bots are in that comment section, it's beyond pathetic.
State of the Onion
If you didn't vote Republican you're pretty much a commie.
Todos somos AMERICANOS
Beautiful speech!Even though it was scripted.
Every 3 or 4 minutes he told a lie. That must be a record for a president.
Haha that part where Democrat Joe Manchin is clapping and is half way standing up when Chuck Schumwe snaps his neck his direction to give him the evil eye telling him to sit down. Kind of sad  the Democrats like Joe don't have a spine to do what they want and will submit to their overlord master's bidding

What a great state of the union address. God bless America.
i love the way he addresses the first lady of the United States!
You know what, I do not support most of Mister Trump's views and positions, but this speech was good, nice work Mr. Trump.
What so special about the black and Hispanic unemployment rate in America. This man is a tone deaf racist scum. Smh
NBC use to be my favorite network back in the 80's. Now it's nothing but crap.
What a president! What a patriot! Trump is building a true American nation. He is making American a nation in the true sense of the word. God bless President Donald John Trump!
Pathetic self congratulatory speech that makes absolute no sense and full of lies. America, look what you have done.

Fake! Russia hacked trumps speech!
I’m like, can we please let the man talk and stop clapping after every sentence?
it doesn't matter if you are a Dem or Rep, or etc.  if you don't agree with what our president just said in this speech, or you still have such a problem with him, then you really just have your own problems.  that was a great speech and he is not wasting anytime get things right.  Thank you, Trump.
I agree this is a good speech, and I don't support Trump or democrats in any way...
But nearly all of the facts he talked about where proven false by a non-partisan committee. 
I find it scary that people don't care about this :(
If any of you guys want more subs on your channel. Subscibe to me and I will subscibe back to you
Trump is taking credit for what president obama actually did.Just go search up the facts.
The Democrats were so disrespectful, and they expect people to listen to them? Give me a break. MAGA 🇺🇸

This was a fantastic speech. I wish he always acted this polite and serious.
The whole speech was facts and success over the past year! Win after Win for Americans! Those Democrats looked like a mad kindergarten class! Pathetic! The Trump train is running over all there lies and fraud!! Choo Choo!!
Good
YouTube probably preloaded the dislikes
Trolls everywhere
How many countries leaders even mention an American immigrant in there country, let alone worry about if they are being treated fairly... Americans do need to unite and take care of eachother. Pathetic how the Dems and Republicans cant unite for the good of the people in this great county.

Sickening how the democrats sit there stone faced, won't stand, and won't clap when President Trump is stating the improvements they made for the citizens, yet they "Love this country and our people"? Even when stating the largest black and Hispanic increase of jobs in history! They are so stubborn and disrespectful. They should be thrown out for contempt! Trump is not an honorable man, but he IS a hard worker and does love this country. He has worked 20 hours per day and done a great job! Pray for and support our president and leadership.
I love our President!!!!! 🇺🇸👍🏻❤️

The country's doing great but everything coming out of DC is toxic and controversial. Such is the way of American politics. It's not the left, or the right that's the problem. It's our political system.

I am not sure how people disliked President Trump's speech?  It was really good, and it was worth the 1 hour and 20 minutes I spent.  Also, I can say that I am middle-class and I got a 9% raise this year, because of tax breaks.
44:29  AMEN!!!
im am tired of seeing US politics on the frontpage
I really just came to realize that the Democrats are very bad losers and it gets to show that they are not the good ones. From now on I do not call myself a Democrat anymore. What a relief!
The partisanship in this country has to end, the worst enemy to this country right now is 24hrs news cycles, (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, TYT) the hacks on these shows are dividing us.  
Everyone has to give up something to compromise, no one can get everything they want politically.
🇺🇸Great speech!!!🇺🇸
He’s taking credit from the Obama Administration, You so supposed Politicians should really under stand sanctions and loopholes that the Obama administration used to safeguard the United States from a future president administration does. It happens every election, even George Bush did the same thing. Good thing we only have about 3 years or sooner of this guy.
I am an American and I love this man. Trump 2020.
Trump 2020!!!!! I was smiling the entire time. So proud to be an American right now! Democrats need to loosen up, show some respect to our leader!

President Trump and his team are standing up to the most powerful liars in history. God bless President Trump.

Unfortunately, the truth is, the United States Government does NOT follow nor represent the principles and stipulations of America's Organic/Foundational Laws and actually works fervently to subvert them 24 hours per day and this is primarily because of the treason and subversion that took place with the help of corrupt Presidents, Congresses and Courts/Judges from about 1913 through 1938 and since.  America and Americans were SOLD OUT to the Global Bankers and the New World Order and our government hasn't been lawful since.

I can’t believe people so fervently support this man, granted, The Democrats are bad too so if you only voted because he was the lesser of two evils then you’re at least trying to be reasonable.

But especially after this first year in office, he is taking the country in a completely destructive direction. He said he would drain the swamp but then goes and appoints the most establishment cabinet in history. How can he be for the working man if his cabinet is filled with corporate leaders who put their corporations before workers?

He gave a massive tax cut to the rich and corporations who keep getting more and more cuts with every president and still evade taxes in offshore havens. Even with this companies like carrier still shipped jobs out of America despite the tax cuts. The cuts are minimal to the average person and a huge one to the rich. This continues to put America in debt and the people are under serviced in government programs

Like or hate Obamacare, the fact is that it decreased uninsured Americans by a lot every year as that is the only insurance they could afford. Although it does have issues which must be addressed, repealing it is not the answer. The system before Obamacare was much worse. 45,000 dying every year due to no access to preventative healthcare. Medical bills still the most common form of bankruptcy. American healthcare is one of the most expensive in the world and covers much less people compared to other developed nations. Yet instead of improving Obamacare or move it forward to a public option or single payer as Trump himself supported in the last, he keeps trying to repeal it regardless of his own voters who would lose their insurance. 

His foreign policy increased the drone strikes that Obama already had escalated before Bush. Drone strikes have a huge civilian casualty rate, his first approved military raid killed an 8 year old american girl.

The unemployment rate was already going down before he even got elected. It was already the trend of the economy recovering from the crash in 2008. He has no credit for that. The effects of his economic policies will be taking place a few years from now, not the first. 

This is only his first year and it is already filled with policies and goals that are against the common man. How can people still continue to support him?
*Even parrots can talk*
end trump and any spineless assclown that supports "it" vote.
Obama was president for 8 years and things just got better now when he’s not president, he gets all the praise from dems? Makes no sense at all
The global elite (Illuminati) does not want America great again. They are going to have Trump assassinated. Same thing happened to JFK.
People are waking up and it cannot be stopped. We see through the lies. Trump is awesome.
Lol at 6:30 the dem from New York looks like a Batman villian
Today our nation is greatly strug........awww look at the kitty
Just realized that the two behind trump are looking at the back of his head the whole time!
This is the pure patriotic American stuff to get this country feeling like it has a chance to change the world.
Just looking at Nancy Pelosi makes me sick inside.
A question to all *Trump supporter* :
Are you racist ?
Just a question ok don't get mad. I don't even live in america ...I'm just curious
First time watching State of the Union Address, very impressed not just with the content, achievements and goals, but more so with the guests and the recognition of families and local heroes.
https://youtu.be/RgaD1i2VoP8 ✅
The impotent dems lashing out online is literally their only play. Your last president did NOTHING good for the country, he completely ignored the economy, racked up 1 trillion in national debt more than all past presidents combined, forced Obamacare through only to have it implode because it was garbage legislature. His legacy is that people liked him. WHAT A USELESS LEADER! Dems, it's time to watch the adults run a country now.
It’s nice to finally have a real leader.
And a SEA of whites, literally not surprised anymore just getting more and more disappointed daily
Its not that he is in presidency honestly sjw need to chill out
Hi youtube, I'm here to say #releasethememo and no, I'm not a Russian bot. 😇

Trump manages to give a half decent speech without rambling off topic and you trumpers are acting like he is the second coming of Jesus. Wtf is wrong with you people, your more obessed with trump than 12yr girls are with taylor swift
This was like a slow trump ralliy.. all talk about no action.
Trump your doing amazing keep doing the good work
Russian bots
The black congressional caucus did not clap when Trump mentioned that black unemployment was the lowest it's ever been!  They didn't clap because they know Obama did it, not Trump!  Trump has only gotten 2 major pieces of legislation done in a year.  He's penned 57 executive orders to bypass the scoundrels in Congress!  But look at the CBC very closely!  They're the brightest we got!  Read their document they gave to Trump, What We Got To Lose.
Trump 2020!

This is a great speech MAGA
Haha funny how the top percent got a 68 million dollar for their paycheck increase when the average american gets 4 cents an hour for their paycheck
Brilliant
Democrats are an embarrassment to this country.
I may not like Trump, but this speech wasn’t that bad to be honest. He outlined a lot of topics, even if on most he didn’t go into much depth, and I liked how he incorporated examples/stories into his speech. However, not a huge fan of the MS-13 and comparing immigrants to criminals breaking into our country, but he could’ve done much worse.
The Video starts at  1:18:23
So we’re gonna just act like the republicans showed President OBAMA the utmost respect during his SOTU Speech??? Yeaaaa oooookkkk 🙄😒
He did absolutely nothing positive during his presidency and I dare anyone to prove me otherwise.

All the good things that have happened are because of the US government doing its job, nothing of it Trump actually affected.

President of US is a weak role in the government, when will people realize this.

Trump did nothing, US government did.

And half of what he said in this is pure lies and the other half is him bragging about stuff he didn't do.

People who actually think this guy is better than ANY president in history is a complete moron.
I have hope for America again! This was the best speech I have heard in my lifetime.
When all the comments are being monitored 👏🏻 we love free speech
Since when was America great to start with
this clown....
And I thought every american was gonna have cheap affordable health care but really 32 million americans are without health care now. I thought there was gonna be more job creations turns out that there are 254,000 fewer jobs than there was 11 months ago.
Note to CBS, NBC showed a nice picture of Trump that doesn't demean him... They got #1 trending spot... You were immature and showed a demeaning picture got a lower loser spot.
It was very disrespectful that the democrats and liberals sat down the whole time and didn't clap. I wonder is they sat down on Sang Ho who experienced so much pain

Trump is the man, if those on the left could see past their bias and the way the corporate media tries to portray him and just look at what hes done objectivly they would see that

Once again, those nasty petty vindictive Democrats bring disgrace to themselves. Pathetic creatures.

These dislikes are all from upset liberals that don’t understand that this country is in a really good position. I don’t understand how what he said was so bad, not one thing in his speech was false or exaggerated. This man has done more then Obama’s 8 year presidency in just about a year. People need look outside their echo chambers and realize what is going on.
I wonder how many of these comments are bots? Or is ever one In  America just rasict

I dont know why people are whining about the Republicans gloating or the Democrats moping. The State of the Union has been nothing but a circlejerk for the party in power for a long time, that goes for both parties.

WORST state of the union address ever from the worst president ever in history, only 2 truths, 4 half truths and the rest were all lies, pathetic orange clown

How many likes can we get on this comment for Donald Trump? 👍
Fantastic, inspiring speech! USA! USA! 🇺🇸
This is the man who called other countries shitholes, threw paper towels and said he was helping during the hurricane, and didn’t even try to extend help to California for the fires. You would think that people would look at these things, among others, and see that this man is not a good president. But no. People still support him. I worry about what America is going to become
God Bless President Trump!
12:58 the zodiac killer!
People fail to realise many people who supported Obama voted for Trump in the 2016 election. Why? Because the other candidate's policy proposal is not good...
He reminds me of Nixon so much
After this speech , I'm leaving the country and going to Alaska.
I see a very large amount of positive comments are from people from other countries, Trump is already starting to try and hack the 2020 election.
Idk why so many people are having such a hard time over this. I watched the entire thing and was not offended by anything.
Viva la figa
Pretty astonished by how many liberal trump haters still suffer the post election scenario. They need therapy.

Is it me or does it seem that Paul Bryant is old enough to be my grandfather. 🤔 TBH all of them are old enough to be my great grandparents. 🤣🤣🤣
EPIC DRUMPF
So glade I voted for you mr president
I don't think trumps wife loves him anymore .-.
17k like a for Trump, 14k dislikes for NBC News
My only complaint is that Trump should not have given any recognition to the North Korean defector. For his own security. Otherwise, this was an excellent speech!
This whole Dem Vs Republican should be turned into a Manga
*_Oh, I thought this was SNL._*
#Go Trump, screw the haters. You are the best President thus far. People talk is cheap! Actions speak louder! 
Trump has done more than Obama so choke on that one. Obama got all the people who didn't want to work free phones though..I forgot that one.
Logan Paul came on an ABC exclusive and its on my channel :0
As expected, Trump was *dishonest*- taking credit for Obama's accomplishments, *divisive* - demonizing immigrants by associating them all with violent crime and even putting down NFL athletes protesting against racism , and *disingenuous* - calling for unity while making no effort to address any concerns of the majority (be it DACA, Russia, institutional racism & sexism, the climate, or Dark Money). No wonder so many didn't go, even his Koch bros bosses are planning for his leave.
So like, Trump has done nothing but disrespect the Democratic Party all year and people expect them to clap after every sentence? As someone who is neither a Democrat or a Republican, that is some twisted logic. As the President of the United States he should show respect to both the Republican Party AND the Democratic Party. Only showing respect to one side divides people and should be avoided if possible.
Trump the great divider
Amazing speech
I don't need or want your likes.
Look at all those dirty disgusting democrats.
Kim Jong Trump sure does clap for himself just like his muse Rocket Man
liberals were one of the reason there was no ww3 . lets see how long ultra conservatives go .
Coming from me, a hardcore democratic family and me being a democrat for 3 years of my life and being 15 and so involved, I’m happy to say, I am going from holding a Bernie sign for a year and a half, to now going to vote for Donald Trump in 2 years for re-election in the state of NEW YORK!
The real irony is the people who founded America were illegals who stole Native American  territory from Mexico. Mexico was formed through Spanish colonials integrating with the largest native population in North America eventually gaining it's independence from Spain. Donald  Trump is a illegal immigrant himself lol
At 1:10, Melania looks like she 's about to cry. And where is her son?
How did we go from the Obama’s, a family that really did represent the best of the country, to the moronic trumps.
Superb president

F
Trump you did this through me i am not proud to be white
Great speech, one for the history book.
You white people stole the world you do not deserve to be our president
Let me tell you how much i've come to hate democrats since i began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex. If the word "hate" was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundred of miles it would not equal one one billionth of the hate i feel for democrats at this micro-instant.
No white man molested me you guts ridiculed everyom
Ne and should ferl honored..
From elections to now..i am not so releade my body and dont fame for how I feel this world should become
You guts are hirrible actors should be ashmad.. You trump have been faking the world who you are through me..you should be ashmaed..
Excellent speech and very professional. It's clear he has goals for this presidency and he is pro American for everything, in much contrast with Obama or Hillary... #buildthewall #USA
President Dr. Trump is a legend! MAGA
Look at this troll of a president 🤣 thank god I have dual citizenship!
America the beautiful home of the free and you white people did this to me..you guys should be ashamed in this government trumo malina you are dispicable to my nation
Iam glad you feel prpud taking my life over and using it Im ashamed of this and dont care to luve because you
https://soundcloud.com/user-71860302/spin-prod-by-kmelzi
Quit actin innocent and not through me to act like me when i saw you yhrough my tv
America is a laughing stock of the world..."clean coal", $22 billion wall, expanding the war on terror in the middle east, which was destabilized by your war crime presidents. All this while cutting taxes that fund what made America great decades ago. Every developed nation knows that America is printing money it does not have. Pride before the fall America. You idiots think you can have the cake and eat it too. A bunch of delusional self centered divided and conquered people.
I think this was Trumps early re-election campaign. He won the people over, the Democrats screwed themselves
Youshould be ashamed trump for doing this trump you did elections through my gead playing acting like me
So what if you hate the guy? He's getting it done for everybody.
If you think this is great, you may need to see Obama's from 2016...
i adore trump
Politics are well to uplift the order of God's written law. I want to clear the atmosphere & only release any poisons effecting us all emotionally, physically, mentally & all.
 Like the fantasy of living like a millionaire?want to make your dreams come true. Exercise the brain with the good karma points get into a relaxed theta state and let any comforting thoughts flow. Also Like Trip Report Toons. Haha & vote libertarian me into office hah
An hour and twenty minutes of Trump arrogantly patting himself on the back and watching his two goons clap for him?  No thanks.
Trump 2020
Go trump go we love you
Mad Lad single handedly destroys one of the world strongest nation

Just here to dislike same as every other American. Sorry NBC I know you agree with me when I say I can not stay awake for the lies coming out of this garbage man.
People talking about democrats not clapping when it was literally the same way when Obama gave his speech
I am Man of faith/Hispanic/Millennial/Worker, thank you Mr. President, God bless.

No matter the president, the state of the union address is always so freaking boring.
Not enough clapping.

Wonder how long this took to upload..
More pathetic than I thought possible. What a puppet POS fraud.
Funny how this looks like a parody
Love you Trump.  I know 17 Democrats that have now changed their party & now support you.  Great job Trump.  You are in good shape for 2020 !
14:59 Corey in the House
those men behind DT annoy me.
Although I’m not a trump supporter, and know both sides go down the same path really, you gotta admit, it was a good union of the state address
Www
I hate Donald trump!!!!!
Worst president ever.
He should dye his hair red https://youtu.be/vjP4FWkCu-Y
I love this guy.
Where is the idiotic, insane, russian operative I hear so much about?
Why does this look like a comedy central skit?
Pelosi was chewing on her dentures the whole time.
Out of hundred of people clapping I can hear President Donald Trump slow clap
I'm ready to get rid of all of them and start over with people who want to compromise and meet in the middle somewhere. This divisiveness is ridiculous and both sides play into it.
This comment section makes me sick. What a bunch of blind idiots. If you think he's doing a good job you are incredibly stupid.
Trump vs NWO 😱
Make America Great Again! 🇺🇸
Americans are dreamers too.. And lazy morons!
"Clean Coal" What's that genius?
Obviously the people paid to clap are sitting on the left lol.
That’s daddy
Lol what a joke
Trump: "In god we trust."
Liberal atheists: *_"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"_*
You know what would really help tons of Americans? Federally decriminalized marijuana
A sad night for Democrats and liberals. 
They hate it when America is righteous and strong.
I don't understand... This was a really good State of the Union Address and people in this comment section are saying it was bad. What is the issue? He was talking about how good in shape the US economy is right now.
Hello from Russian Fedsration.
Building that wall will create more jobs. Trump will create more jobs for Americans. Look at it from a different perspective for once.
Trash
Memo please 😎👍🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This guy just makes me sick.
It's moments like 39:00 where I question how could mainstream media giants downplay what the president has shown..
Good job Donald
https://youtu.be/ErsgPXd431E
I’m not American but why this video has so many dislikes?
Who's the joker that put the super glue in the Democrats seats !?
Honestly a great speech, I'm a democrat but I want to make my career in public speaking.  Even though I disagree with a majority of his policies I am disappointed many media giants downplayed his speech when in fact it was great!
“If there’s a mountain, we climb it. If there’s a frontier, we cross it.” 
IF THERE’S A BORDER WALL, WE JUMP IT!
I don't get why alt-left Youtube keeps putting his speech on Trending. To make money cause everybody views it despite their opposition? You could keep Grammys propaganda and now Black Lives Matter propaganda on instead of covering Trump or the Memo.

Haven't always liked our current pres but this was a good speech. Feeling blessed to be an American again. #proud

Great speech!
Good speech
Thank you sir! We stand with you!
30mins of handclapping👳
#ReleaseTheMemo #MAGA
You cant fight truth with truth. You have to fight truth with a lie and the more right Trump is the more wrong the democratic party is. In fact, they are just plain ugly wrong and that is self evident as seen here!
To the people who do not have enough respect for this country and the process of our government to be polite and show respect to your President to clap......you should be ashamed of yourselves.
The Democrats showed how disgraceful they are the during the whole state of the union.
The best part of this speech is that it wasn't given by Hillary Clinton.
His speech determines his ability to rebuild the unity and prosperity in America. He will be A real great leader and hero.
He smiles like a 5 year old who just finished his vegetables & is waiting for a reward.
Great speech, finally we have a president who thinks about real people....
lol when NBC filters comments to show only positive  ones... Pathetic
你问我资次不资次，我是资次的
Trump 2020 !!!!!
I shouldn't have my tax dollars goto someone who has kids....those arent my kids
America...this is embarrassing. Why can't you lead yourselves?
I don’t care what Trump does, just don’t start a WW3 please.
After the entire nation gets screwed on taxes in 2017.....The only way he wins in 2020 if he gives us all a giant tax break not only in our checks but in our returns.....period
VVV Mike Pence win not you ! VVV NOBODY
I don’t like the messenger personally, but America’s future is finally looking bright again after about 30 years of darkness!  The economy is up (not based on Obama), jobless claims are down, the unemployment rate for blacks and hispanics is historically down, everyone will have more money in their pocket whether you’re white, black, brown , or other, whether you’re heterosexual, homosexual, transgender, or fluid, whether you’re rich, poor, or somewhere in between.  Jobs by the millions are being created, industry is returning, Detroit even is being revitalized after being left for dead by previous administrations.  We have a government who will put Americans as the priority before people who break the law to be here, yet create a path to citizenship for those 1.8 million brought here as young children.  A government that will protect us from terroristic gangs both foreign like ISIS and imported like MS-13.  A government that will finally take steps to protect our borders to maintain our sovereignty.  A government that will hold its employees accountable.  Among many other things, and most importantly, a government that will acknowledge that we are a country who remembers that, it is in God that we trust!
I'd hope to go back to the original motto: e pluribus unum "out of many, one." I feel like it better represents what  America was founded to be about, a nation of many individuals and states coming together for the betterment of all...
wow great speech
NBC the apidamy(sic) of FAKE NEWS.
Trump 2020. MAGA!!!!!
Pres. Trump boasted about all the jobs that have been created since his election, while ignoring that fact that since his inauguration the pace of job growth has been the slowest since 2010.
TRUMP ☝💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Most successful president in YEARS
NBC's hatred has made them CRAZY, TDS is real an amazing thing to see.
7 minutes  and  just  too  much  clap 👏  xd  jesus 
how dare the democrats sit while they were honoring the parents of the children killed by ms 13 members who should have never been here.  democrats seriously have no shame whatsoever.
It reminds me of some religions. stand up, sit down, kneel, do 25 
hail mary's , sing a hymn , repeat 20 more times. Government is a 
religious cult I tell you.
i bet you didn’t know that in the new Sprite commercial with Lebron as the pitcher. the Referee from Dodgeball is the Umpire behind the plate!!!
It was around the 10 minute mark that he started, giving interesting looks. He is well trained at lying, but he gave subtle clues that everything wasn't true. Such as after saying a potential lie. He would look around just to see the reactions. See how well his possible lie is. What a divided nation we have because half in the room stood up and cheered. The other half sat there awkwardly.
I don’t hate the man but I like memes
I have to laugh NBC has deleted their commentary as well as the Democratic rebuttal. That kinda says a lot. 😂😂
Great speech!!
Felt so patriotic while watching this
I love President Trump!! He was the first president I was old enough to vote for and I will never regret it!! Such a great American.
All you people are stupid Donal is
Not makeing America better if he was their would not be problems with Korea
seems... we are very divided.. 

never seen this much polarization in congress.
Best State of the Union speech I've ever seen. God bless our President, the heroes present in the capital tonight, the heroes serving outside it, and the whole USA.
This man really makes me proud to be an American once again!! Thank you Mr. President! I would be honored to meet you one day.
Am I the only one who is tallying how many times they stood up? 😂
F trump!
So many lies and deceptions.
Republicans are so easily manipulated it's make me hurt...
What a joke
Mr. President Donald Trump best president for this nation since  ex president Eisenhower Mr. president Donald Trump best world Leader God protect and bless our beloved president and his lovely family forever!!!!
God bless & protect you Pres Trump! Bring back the American dream.
Trump is all about racism.
Misleading the people of America to destruction.
Accept Jesus In you’re life before is to late.
Y’all  need to stay woke brothers . 🙌🏻
He is hilarius.make america great...lol
President Trump! Best President in my lifetime too!
I dont always agree with trump, but i do agree that the democrats took a fat L
Shut babylon downm
Shame on the Democrats for their poor behavior. Whose side are they on?
50% gibberish talk,
50% clapping,
=100 % BULLSHIT.😂
Great job Mr President!! We are very proud of you!!
Thank you Mr President! You saved me 1000.00 per month on Obama Care! Also, just received an 8000.00 bonus!! Thank you so much for all you have done in just one year!! Those of us that are really paying attention absolutely love you and the work you are doing!! God bless you! God bless America!
Is this the Q.V.C. channel??? Is he selling something..I believe in trump but I feel like he's selling something..maybe a dream....He in 8 years is not gonna fix the debt were in so... again we are making supposedly some progress but not no where enough dent to really put a mark on something. I do feel he has done more in 1 year than Obama did in 8 .Lmao a T.V. entertainment host. Smfh, now Oprah.... WHEN WILL WE WAKE UP AND SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!! It's in our constitution rights to as a ppl over throw the government if their not for the PPL! WHEN WILL WE BECOME A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH!!????
People now in days just get stuck in such a stupid little bubble that Trump has created to "make America great" but honestly people are blind enough to not see it's already great. You so called "american" are ungreatful that this country if full of ethnicities that make this place a better living condition and taking in hard labor for those weak Americans who can't do.. so open your eyes and just think for a second how this place is better without a president like him
Drain the swamp of all politicians. Government is mind control. It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it. Just listen to Trump, a corporate CEO of the united states corporation and head of a fascist kakistocracy while puppets behind the scenes pull the strings. The whole world's a stage! Just look at those sigils on either side of the corporate flag. What are fasces the symbols of fascism doing there? Fascism is a government merged with corporations and paper fictions are what these evil doers hide behind. Corpse-orations in a cap-it-all-istic cyst-stem rotten to it's fiat core!
Einstine trumps goodbfriend is a pedo.biden creepy.
Ahh democrats..... unwilling to change their unproductive ways.....always trying to find flaws in anyone or anything they see as an obstacle...never seeing its strength..... better "hope....to change" as Obama out it
Still a pedo island mossad spy. What a cartoon.
Da shiznit.
I’m pretty sure they had people holding signs that read “clap now”
If they want to do drugs let them. Not my problem.  Natural selection. I am now willing to pay. It is not a tax payers responsibility to pay for problems that are not are own.
Praise Jesus Christ (Lord and Savior of the world) for our wonderful president!!! May God bless President Trump!!!
The Democrats hate America, hate patriots, hate our flag and our national anthem. They think half the country are racist, believe illegals should get more attention then the American people.  They thrive on keeping blacks down and under their  control.  They hate the people who serve in the military and the rule of law, and they hate the constitution.  And they just proved it to you during this speech.
Too late..the damage is done!  There is nothing presidential about his character.  It has nothing to do with political party preference.  It's about human dignity and he has displayed NONE!  Greedy, bigot, liar, draft dodger and hypocrite just to name a few of his characteristics.  Ignorance is unacceptable.... this country deserves better.
9:05 "ever recorded"





AAAARGH
Great speech! Democrats proved to the people that they are anti-American!
Why is it when Trump wants to put America first he is called a fascist??? Washington originally stated in his farewell address that the country should be first. I guess Washington is a fascist...
Lies. Deceptions. Every day, more lies.
If youtube only wants to promote all this liberal bs then why would they put up this full video showing how we are doing better
I seriously thought this was Saturday Night Live...
He doesn’t even talk about his plans he just talks about what he did
Very telling that the Democrats look like they got kicked in the nuts every time President Trump notes how America is doing better...
Came to leave my dislike not listen to 1 hr of gibberish
Thank you Mr. President! I believe in you!
Man I'm not even a Trump supporter but this was actually a good speech.  Some of you need to grow up.
God is good
TrumpNation 🇺🇸
Wow trump vs everyone else. 
Go trump
Obama never instilled any confidence in me when he did the SOTU. Trump does. It's so gratifying to have a real leader again.

Also, thanks for the shout-out to the Cajun Navy, Mr. President. Most people tend to forget about everything Louisiana does for the rest of the Union.
Trump sucks
The ending was really powerful
#MAGA
The Left wants a president who hates this country. I'm so thankful Trump is our President!  I love my country and am grateful that we have freedom and liberty to do so much in this great Nation! No-one is perfect, but Trump really cares about America and our citizens!
The dems are so disrespectful. Omg they made me cringe. They clearly hate America.
that s my president !
Trash
I want him and the Republican Party to rot and suffer!
this was such a powerful speech man forreal. how can you not like trumo?? all he wants to do is make life better for us!! THATS ALL! "dreamers are americans too" LMAO what happened cnn!? you told me trump wanted dreamers to be ordered to the guillotine!
That's what I don't get... I might not like or agree with a president but for the SOTU I would not be chatting or be glued to my phone... If said president said something I did agree with I would stand up also.... It's fine if you disagree with trump cuz u got your rights, but that's disrespectful to do things some off he people on the floor were doing to trump...
Every time I jumped around to a different time stamp, people were clapping... That's about a half hour of the "Speech" right there.
This just proves that Trump is even better then Obama. He's actually doing something ( and i don't mean releasing information and money to enemy countries) whatever to the democratic news who says lies about Trump. Lets make america great again
Dems are like passengers on a plane that wants the pilot to crash
Go Trump!
Need MEMO. #releasethememo
Are all those Democrats sucking lemons or what?
Donald Trump worst president in history
Ashley is an American hero!
He’s doing such a great job.
#samoansfortrump release the memo
Thank Almighty God!
36:02 I feel so bad for Bernie 😭😭
NBC, thank you so much for telling me what to think. I don't think I could function in life without you.
Very straightforward, he's basically vlogging lmao. This was absolutely ridiculous!

I LOVE IT, THIS IS THE BEST PRESIDENT IN US HISTORY!!
The crowd claps every Trump statement spoiler
He wants people of every race, religion, gender and queed.
trash
just realized some of the highest liked comments in here are pro trump. these are russian bots, people. dislike and move on, don't reply.
Did I just witness a president clap for himself?
Truth, Justice, and the American Way! A timely and excellent State of the Union address! President Donald Trump is exactly who we need for our time and right now! Make America Great Again (MAGA) is the USA people's battle cry that will ring in every ear! Now roll up the sleeves and get to work to make it happen or you are fired!
I do believe Trump will go down in history as the greatest president ever, Awsome Speach!!! Dems acting like spoiled children who lost the game lmfao
Democrats either can't except what Trump has done or they are accrediting it to Obama.... a year later... and they don't know shot about how economics or politics work

This is funny... If a person does not clap in our Chinese People's Congress, he will be put into jail the next day : )
I have a pep in my step after this speech. I loved every second. If anything, too short!
we need a third party president... divisiveness in this country is terrible right now we need someone to mediate between both sides and to take ideas from both
I wonder why he isnt wearing his white power tie
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕☠☠☠☠☠😈😈😈😈😈🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
i really think there have been shootings that are politically motivated by the left to strike at the right. and that there is a cover up. just sayin.
People come to celebrate a good year. Not come to the end of the world. That exactly you see Democrats have come with hate in their hearts. They have spent money to dress in fancy regalia to show hate. Can you believe this showmanship Dems spend on special dresses just to show the world we hate Donald Trump? People spend money for party fun, to dance, love, friendship, but dress in funeral attire to bury the democratic party for good. Yes, this is the end of the Democratic Party. Believe me, this is last you will see them ever take on the Government. Good riddance to bad rubbish.
Rock and Roll bud
God bless America! Trump 2020!
Crazy how he can just come in a year and take credit for what Obama did he had 8 long years of fixing bush mistakes and this dumb people really believe TRUMP MADE A DIFFERENCE
Its been a year people.its time to break the conditioning. If you hate trump its by design. You are suppose to hate him. If you do you fall into the exact same category as the weak minded idiots who hated Obama..congrats
Who wrote this speech for him cause he dnt feel like that
Wouldn't be surprised if the script wasn't written by him.
Reality check for you Trump.
I am 54 years old.
I have never seen or had $10 an hour job.
How do people afford
 cars and homes!?
American speeches are much less composed as older ones. But I suppose by keeping his speech simple, more people can readily grasp it.
I wonder... who are the true racists? The person who’s trying to benefit everyone (including communities of color) or the people not clapping when it’s revealed that he did something amazing for the good of America?
Nice job Mr President! Suprisingly good. I'm starting to actually not hate you!
Old white guys-STOKEDEVERYONE ELSE-NOT STOKED
It must be killing Nancy P. to sit there and watch Pres. Trump hit a home run.
Doing it for my civics HW.
To seek out new life and new civilizations, & to use way too much tan in a can.
Does he keep mentioning his wife out of guilt?
Fake news
Fdt
love america
great job
trump！！！
President Trump!!! What an amazing pro AMERICAN speech!
2nd time trying to watch this and yet again he's made me physically nauseated. What a joke of a president, what a joke of a party. 

We need to get rid of the 2 party system, give the people better choices!
Democrats hate news about minorities doing good,Dems feel like minorities belong to them,how dare you thank trump for anything! your my property!
Democrats hate news about minorities doing good,Dems feel like minorities belong to them,how dare you thank trump for anything! your my property!
Democrats sat on their hands due to HILLARY most likely would put the hit on anyone that clapped or stood !
The Dems we're on their phones when he talked about veterans how disrespectful.
Boring content. Boring Acting. I yawned, what can I say? You get sleepy.
Wow. Amazing speech Mr. President! Rising wages, lower taxes, count me IN!
The first best state of union since George Washington. Other president talk bull crap or about there self. ..
this guy knows nothing about politics, he wants to upgrade our nuclear arsenal yet wants other countries to get rid of theirs. He declares that there's a war on clean coal(doesnt exist) and his foreign policy is basically to intimidate Russia and china. Worst president in the history of modern america, those who think otherwise knows it and is unwilling to say the democrats were right. Theyd rather pull america down rather than admitting theyre wrong.
Time to vote out all those non American Democrats.
American people are reality not dreamer. ...dreamer don't get the job done only back bone and muscle. ..
The Democrats don't clap for anything good Trump says, it's literally like they're in grade school.
I love trump
Sheesh. The audio is way too compressed. You can hear it when everyone claps. SMH
Maga
This is American Great again.
Great speech! Thank you Mr. President Donald Trump, Mr. Vice President Mike Pence & Congress for creating a United States of America, we all can be proud of searching for the American dream! All Americans are Dreamers! #MAGA #LetTrumpBePresident 🇺🇸✌😘💕
lmao i love saturday night live
Them democrats aren't happy notice that.
Look at them Dems. a bunch of brats like the kids these days ..
Even if it was all bs it would be somewhat ironic if we were looking for Russian bots when back in the Cold War the Russians were probing for "western spies"
14:55 she's cute
I hope Bernie runs for 2020 and can fix the damage that the Republicans are doing to our country! Trump is making a fool of our country in the eyes of the world
Grab em' by the 











2nd amendment
President trump? He’s more than that. More like KING Trump.  I Wish he could rule forever.
Poor old Pelosi is just trying to remember which President is speaking!!!   LOL. Gaye Furlow, not a fan of Old Pelosi
American will never be great again not with him In the office. Ww3 in the making. Thanks
We don't need Republicans or Democrats, we need a reform, 2 corrupt parties should not control the government
Lol Paul Ryan needs to go neck himself
God bless America, good night!
Lol trump is fake news come at me salt lords ;)
Can we watch anything that isn’t biased, NBC? #NBC #Sucks
hahahaha, at the 34:10 mark he touts the 1.5 million jobs  yada yada.  it reminds  back to the future of the 1.5 jigawatts of electricity.    he kills me
American citizen dreamers>illegal dreamers
@NBC sucks! #NBC your bias lead into the SOTU address was not too clever and clearly obvious. But guess what, this whole narrow broadcast, give them the story in five Minutes or less style is dated and soon to be obsolete. #SOTU #NBCNEWS #Bias #CableTVSucks
@ 1:14:28 Tiny Kim from A Christmas Carol.
I find it strange that nbc didn’t include their commentary about Russia right before his speech
We see all these sitting,  no honor resides them. They must be voted  out drain the swamp of the parasites.
I guess the whole small percentage of people who approve of Trump showed up to post here. Many of them paid republican operatives, LOL
This is the greatest piece of propaganda I've ever seen.
Ewie
this is the best president of the united states i mean you guys deserve the best because you are the best hahaha
Elon Musk for 2020
lol bernie sanders 36:05 ---- 36:12 so enthusiastic! :}
TRUMP 2020
Not in the mood to read these comments and see all these Trump supporters
who the fook is this guy???
every time he talks, we all lose IQ points
Do u know de wey
In the State of the Union, Pelosi sat with a scowl 
Words of solidarity churn in the democrat bowel
Roar of applause followed the words they would hear
They had to stay seated, Republicans can smell fear
Addressing tragedy, the compassionate draw tears
While lefts ready their interpretations with sneers 
Their wild accusations thrown with smug little faces
"He's working with the Russians" or maybe  "he's racist"
ANOTHER THREE YEARS! No one can take away
Not even with their fake Russian dossier
Democrats aren't only anti Pres Trump, but also they seem anti American..
Flint Michigan has no water fuckboi
Release the memo👏
"Make America great again for all Americans", what about those Central Americans?
Trump 2020 you got my vote
I’m only 18 and I strongly believe this man is the greatest president since Regan. He has accomplished so much more than any president has done in one term more likely than in one year.
we love Our President
God Bless America's President! 🙏🏻🙏🏻
I believe Pres. Trump is an awesome President. Keep it 100% Donald!!! 😎😎😎
Thumbs up to you MR President
Thank you Lord for giving this Nation a President who's heart is to do thy will... I'am so Thankful...A Veteran
Vote out the sorry democrats  who applaud  nothing. Bad characters for sure
I think this administration is going to be better than Donald Reagan's administration...This speech is so amazing
I was no fan of Trump but man, he’s done a fine job and really exposed the Democrats for their BS. They didn’t stand when black unemployment levels are at an all time low, they didn’t clap or stand for the anthem or anything. They sat there like babies with their pacifiers. It showed me who they really are and that they don’t care about minorities or the middle class, or even America.
His name  is MR Trump the peoples president.  Thank you  sir
You know, it would be good for all of the Republicans and Democrats to be required to sit together. None of this having parties sit together with each other only.  That would force communication.
MAGA! 🇺🇸
I'm here for the clapping 😂😂😂
Yay he's taking credit for results from the Obama FY.
Love this man, Our President!
Don't worry about Dems, don't you guys have the ball. Start acting like winners and focus.
my civics teacher had me write a summary on this speech
The last eight years was about redefining America. This speech was defining  accurately what America is and has always been: a country based on faith, family and patriotism!
The last eight years was about redefining America. This speech was defining  accurately what America is and has always been, a country based on faith, family and country.
Nah. Obama is the reason everything is going good with Economy. That's why the Black Caucus didn't stand. This man is a Con plain and simple.
That was good. I'm glad I watched it. It gives me a whole new kind of optimism for our country which is deeply broken and needs the necessary changes to commence in order to become better.  To the nay sayers, don't worry. We've got plans for you too. You'll enjoy the benefits as well.
Baka
Id like to live in a world where we all clap each other after each sentence.
Great president!
Love how the African Americans care about record low numbers 😂 we are all on the same plane and they still want to shoot the pilot 😂
You'd be hard pressed to find a better example of why the last 30+ years have been in stagnant decline than look at the left side of that chamber. They don't want to fix things, unless it's uder their terms, and their terms have worked so well over the last several decades.... not
Dems seem don't want to see America Great  that why they stuck in chairs. GO TRUMP 2020
Since when is coal beautiful or clean?!! The only thing beautiful about coal are the profits lining the pockets of the elite and rich. I live overseas in a city where coal is burned for heat and electricity, and without the regulations of the EPA, we are covered by a constant cloud of smog. It smells, it burns to breath and it is disgusting. I appreciate the heat and power it provides, there is beauty in that during this unusually cold winter, BUT it makes me appreciate the influence of the EPA.  Coal needs to be replaced. And so does this president.
I don’t understand how ppl “hate trump” if they don’t look facts I’m not saying I like him but he has done good stuff. Also another thing I don’t get is that even If he does something good and you know it why do ppl still pin it against him. Like if he gave a homeless shelter 10,000 the news and some of us would still badmouth him! Why? Bc he said one racist thing and made a mistake I’m not justifying his mistakes but I’m not pinning all of our problems to him. Thank you for reading😊 btw I’m only in 7th grade so what do I know right ?Wrong!🙃

Fighting the good fight
Seems like Democrats hate America
Jesus is indeed Lucifer the Morning Star, which is why Isaiah 14:12 lists Lucifer as the Morning Star and then Jesus calls himself the Morning Star in Rev 22:16.  The reason Christards fail to see the obvious is because they are brainwashed by their churches into reading the Bible BACKWARDS and reading the New Testament BEFORE the Old Testament.  We read books from FRONT TO BACK for a reason, and that is because you can't possibly understand the end of a book that you don't understand the beginning of.  And it is not even possible to fully understand a book from reading the LAST QUARTER of it.  With that being said...---->  Adam and Eve were NOT first, and the 2 stories of Creation in Genesis are NOT about the same Creation as the Christian church teaches.  GOD makes people on the 6th day of Creation in Genesis 1:26.  Then in Genesis chapter 2 God rests, God sanctifies the 7th day, and then the LORD God of Israel creates Adam and Eve on the 7th day of Creation.  To work on the 7th day that God has blessed and sanctified is BLASPHEMY, which is what makes the LORD God SATAN the LORD of this world.  That also makes clear that Adam and Eve were NOT FIRST, they were made second.  Doesn't the 6th day of Creation come BEFORE the 7th day of Creation?---->  The family lineage that begins with Adam and ends with Jesus is the family lineage made by SATAN the LORD God, not God.  That's why Isaiah 14:12 lists Lucifer as the Morning Star, and then Jesus calls himself the Morning Star in Rev 22:16.  Jesus was Lucifer in the flesh, not God in the flesh.  Jesus is Lucifer the Morning Star!  Go to my channel for more details...


That NEW WORLD Order that Alex Jones and other GOP Christards pretend to fight is really the goal of Christianity otherwise known as the NEW EARTH (Isaiah 65:17, Isaiah 66:22, 2 Peter 3:13, Rev 21:1) to be ruled by the New Jerusalem.  The New Earth is where the nations are destroyed and massed together for a world government that will be on the shoulders of Jesus.  Well, isn't the New World Order a world government as well?  And gee, New Earth even sounds exactly like New World, doesn't it?  That is not a coincidence, the New Earth is indeed the New World Order.  It's all right there in your NEW WORLD Translation Bible if you actually bothered to read it...  <-)


The GOP already used their NRA lobbying dollars to REWRITE THE 2ND AMENDMENT in 2008. The GOP and the Koch brothers REWROTE THE CONSTITUTION with the Citizens United ruling. Now the GOP has FIVE MORE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS planned for 2017. That makes SEVEN Constitutional Amendments in 9 YEARS for the GOP. Anyone who cares for the CONSTITUTION would NEVER vote for the GOP EVER...


The media in the country is corrupt, it is all right wing Fascist MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX run pro-Christian pro-Israel PROPAGANDA, plain and simple. When has ANY media channel EVER allowed someone like myself to BIBLICALLY challenge the Christian religion? NEVER, because if someone like me had access to major media channels, I would have citizens BURNING EVERY CHURCH IN SIGHT in about 30 minutes flat. ABC is owned by Westinghouse, a major DEFENSE contractor. NBC is owned by General Electric, another huge DEFENSE contractor. And this is the LIBERAL media, huh?? Pfftt, hardly.
The claps were so in sync it sounded weird otherwise great speech by a great president
Now I know what a Democracy is. It's a bunch of butt hurt sellouts that care nothing about this country. God save the Republic.
did anyone else reallize that when he talked abouut the 2 girls that were killed Melania didnt clap. and did anyone else notice that when he talked about black unemployment rates nbc jumped to a whole bunch of black people. im a democrat and hate trump but come on Nbc dont be fake
Where is the family or even the mention of the Dreamer / Vet Alonso Guillen, who gave his life to save people during the hurricane?

Mr. President Trump, you Rock Sir.
God Bless you!!! 
And God-bless the United States of America!!!

Amen!!!
Hmmm...o.k.....
God Bless you President Trump...amazing uplifting speech...thank you..MAGA!
I like how I see 90% positive  comments yet the likes to dislike are almost even.
Wonderful speech trump
Lol, Bernie with his messed up, bitter hair....
USA! USA! USA!
NBC needs to get with current events. The Russian collusion is not with Trump, it's with the DNC. How many times does the FBI have to come out and say it.
One of the best speech.. It’s crazy how I couldn’t stand him in the beginning but now I understand everything he’s doing is going to benefit me a Latino from NYC..
In regards to the gun problem, let's take a look at Chicago which has the sternest legislation for gun control. Same race violence with guns is never addressed by the Democrats. People in Chicago in the inner cities are dying. It looks like the criminals don't give a hoot about legislation.
He makes no apologies for his views and tells it like it is. I’m not sure if we’ve ever had a president like him or ever will again. I’d given up on America years ago. He has given real working Americans actual hope. I didn’t think it was possible anymore. God bless Trump and the USA.
I work in the automotive field.  It six under Obama, especially during the used car rebate Fiasco.
My Lord!! It's Trump Bots heaven in here....
I hope Ryan and Rebecca got the mother some help also, in addition to adopting her baby.
Teflon Don is a BOSS.
Black union electrician here for Trump.  *MAGA*
Authoritarian nativism delivered to US audience with a soft tone. Sad part is not that, it is only half of the population does not even know it. Authoritarian nativism is good when it is benefits you. only the color is the clear deference, if your white. Great your one of the beneficiaries. Yes there are few none whites that are supporting this but they do not know they are the target of this (even family has that crazy uncle). Education and self-reflection is missing from those people. 

Yes, Great day for Authoritarian nativism and for all of the members of it (Trumped white supports) your future looks great! Secured!

THANK YOU GOD FOR PRES. TRUMP
“Breath in”

*WOOOOOH!!!!*
Drain the swamp!!!
You're doing a great job, Mr. President!  I thank you for your service.
America's foundation was built on God!!!!!!! Donald Trump was built for such a time as this and wake up. WE ALL BLEED THE SAME it isn't any different you just have to pick on someone so you just pick him. Pick Jesus since he is really who we need right now and we all will see not much sooner.
Ooh look there are more likes than dislikes :)
PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP = GOAT
It is clear the Nation is totally divided.
Would that steel in America's spine be the kind Trump buys from China?  WTF, Trump the Cajun navy was because your administration failed at emergency response.  Are   you going to keep lying all night?  You''re bragging about people who had to do their jobs under exstrodanary circumstances that wouldn't have happened if your party treated Climate Change as a threat to the world instead of a threat to the corporate bottom line.
When Trump gets more Thumbs up then Down on a liberal site like NBC you Know He Did Great. #Winning
Love this man
Will somebody rid the world of this pathetic excuse for a human being?
Trump's son's ears look like donkey 👂 ears baby new years
As great as the SOTU are I wouldn't like it. All the sit, stand, sit, stand while clapping every 2 sentences lol. Look at the Libs. They're almost crying hahaha. Wait I think a few actually are hahaha
Where does Canada stand with action taken against North Korea? No media?
Politicians are the worst audiences. The first rule of being an audience member when someone is speaking is not to heckle. But whatever, this is all an act for them. It always happens. The opposite party shows up, heckles the leader, and leaves immediately when it's done. My favorite part of this was watching Paul Ryan point out the Dems that actually stood up. 😂
Shithole
I mean, it was a pretty good speech to be honest.
The greatest president in our lifetime.
16:57 Anyone recognize these individuals? I believe the middle one is Jim Teague of Enterprise Products
look at the childishness of the DEMS. its sad and shameful.
AMERICA 1st !

The UK people welcome the President Of The United States to our shores. We too are fighting the liberal left since Brexit. Thank god for President Trump who says that he still support us and doesn't care about what the left has to say ...
Love my President
bruh y this fakeeee they be lyinnnnnn
Too much clapping
okay but imagine if Hilary was in office instead of Trump rn  ( ;; 0__0)
President Trump and the parasite Dems and Repubs will continue to provide the poisoned kool-aid to you MORONS until you wake up to the fact that we have a CRUSHING 20 Trillion Dollar debt that is going to END the Dollar and the Government as we know it, probably by the end of this guy's first term. WAKE UP!!!! Start voting Libertarian instead of the same two snakes!!!!
Keep chewing your cud Nancy Pelosi everyone sees how you betray America
TRUMP 2020 !!!!!!
What’s something with facts trump is doing wrong as a president of a country, the responsibilities that pertains to (Not talking about hurt feelings or offended “adults”).  Efficiency and competency pertaining to sustaining a countries prosperity.  And if someone could, can you disprove with facts, trumps claims on improvements on economy with all races.  Edit: I see some people saying trump can’t take credit for any success because Obama created it when he was in office?  Even though we’re only seeing these percentages of improvement at a significant rate just this year.. and then others say trumps claims are lies lol.  Which one is it? lmao
The fake news has spread fake nudes
This is majestic and yuuuge
Congratulations , President Trump, you hit it out of the park.
Bravo!!!!!
Loving the Tax break! I have kids, finally some real action! Money back in my paycheck!
Healthcare is not a human right. For starters, most of the health issues we suffer from in this country is entirely due to poor diet and lifestyle choices. Most of the remainder of our healthcare issues is because of poor healthcare practices. Secondly, where does it say anywhere in our Constitution, Bill of Rights, or Declaration of Independence that healthcare is a right?
Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Look at piglosi. Lol. That demon had to flee because PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IN GOD WE TRUST. THAT DEMON RAN OUT. SHE IS SO MAD AMERICA IS DOING BETTER THAN EVER. LOL LOL LOL
Love USA
All comments on this video fall into two categories:
1. Fake news! This President sucks and lied a lot during this (insert all the evidence in the world).
2. Man, you all are crazy. He’s a great president. (Insert personal reasons or stuff the president or his cabinet members have said).
There’s literally no in between. There’s also yelling... lots and lots of yelling... because both of those extremes are children who can’t have a decent discussion about anything without being triggered af.

I am surprised so many Trump supporters are watching a video from a news station that constantly makes “fake news” according to trump...
Hard to believe those folks on the left side of the aisle don't applaud or stand in support of the USA, God and the people !!
The Rock 2020
BEST PRESIDENT EVER EVER EVER. NOTICE THE Democrats ARE SO ANGRY THAT AMERICA IS DOING SO SO SO WELL. DEMOCRATS ARE MAD THAT THE ILLEGALS CANNOT VOTE IN OUR NEXT ELECTION. THEY WANT ILLEGALS TO VOTE BUT SAY TRUMP TAMPERED WITH OUR ELECTION. SUCH DUMB PEOPLE. LEAVE OUR GREAT COUNTRY ALL YOU DEOCRATS. GO TO IRAN THE PLACE OBAMA SENT 160 BILLION DOLLARS AND GAVE OUR PEOOLE NOTHING. WE LOVE TRUMP. ALL THE WAY.....
What part of President Trump's address are the Democrats not hearing? Grow up or be Fired for not honoring your pledge. Each government employee swears to defend our nation against all enemies foreign or domestic! Time to carry out that oath that each person swore to uphold.
This proves that the Democratic Party isn't anti-trump their anti-American
I would've stayed standing
This “speech” is 95% clapping
I’m actually just here for social studies homework
How are liberals still mad he said he is willing to give 3x more people path to citizenship that are already here but he not going to allow people to just keep sneaking in nm all new jobs and unemployment down
Many of his claims can be proven to be half-truths through some fact checking online :/
I think he did really well and whether your a trump fan or not , if your a United States fan you’ll like hearing 2.4 million new jobs, unemployment among African Americans at its lowest been in a LONG time, and willing to give 3x more people than obama did path to citizenship
Throw trump in the dump 2020
all those butthurt democrats lmao
awesome
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT ROME FELL IT IS WRITTEN ...WAS BECAUSE ROMANS WERE DISPLACED BY NON-ROMANS...AMERICANS FIND THEMSELVES DISPLACED AS WELL.  WE'RE IN A MELL OF A HESS.  BUT THIS SPEECH HAS BEEN SO GOOD SO FAR THAT EVEN I HOLD OUT HOPE.
No more corrupt politicians and no more war stop making us lose all our British and American ,Australian troops
I hate you Trump. All I came here to say
The Greatest President this country has ever Had!!!
usa
Love how the Dems showed the country how childish and hypocritical they really are. Millions of blacks saw you refuse to stand and clap even when Trump said the black unemployment is at its lowest in 45 years..... you may not be smart enough to know it, but you lost ALOT of votes last night. Myself and other Americans saw you sitting on your hands acting like children, just because you don’t “like” Trump. You also refused to stand and clap for a couple who’s child was murdered. You are evil. Period. TRUMP 2020
President Trump is an amazing Man!
Трумп 2020!
It's funny how the Dems are so upset, cause, you know, things are getting better under Trump
At around 15:40 , Corey in the house.
Sorry
Why are all the timestamps like hours after the act ual speech? Is it Yo ut ube or liberal jokes?
A vast majority of the Democratic party should be fired. Congress is Not meant to be a long term career. They serve us the citizens of this great country and I for one demand they follow suit! I will not be voting for any Democrats in any forward election!
How is he supposed to connect with the working class. he has been handed everything he has ever had
He's been coached.
FACT:  Liberial leftist lunatics hate our Constutional Republic, because the Constitution was written by the evil white man.  They want a new Marxists system to promote their  "UTOPIAN - FREE EVERYTHING" agenda, because then the white man can be killed and removed for diversity, FACT!
Is Pelosi chewing tobacco?
Build the Great American WALL..
I can't believe this is the same Washington I saw as royalty not too long ago. The respect I had for it... sigh.
TRUMP MAY BE A VARMINT...BUT HE'S NOT SHORT ON CHARM AND SALESMANSHIP.  YOU FIND YOURSELF WANTING SO MUCH TO BELIEVE HIM.
“ Our union are strong because our people are strong”. Great job, Mr. Trump!
M A G A
Fun fact:
If you cut out the clapping the video is 22 seconds long
Wonderful to hear God's name deservedly mentioned...hope the liberals take note, learn, listen and shut up
Strong leader , hardest working man in America, it's sad people don't like him just because of the way he looks and they call him the racist.
Anyone else notice how he was begging the dems to stand for him 😂
Nice job Trump!
Perhaps america will be great again
Still feel great about my vote!!🇺🇸💯Look at the Dems....they still dont get it. Smh
The Democrat’s reaction is the reason that this is Trump’s re-election speech
Aye yo rich ppl, it's okay. Take my money. I'm still going to work my 4ss off and make it somehow, someway. As Trump says, "Believe it."
Funny how dems hate anything and everything that’s good for our nation 🙄
The Democrats are the issue, even with the great news, they sit there refusing to acknowledge that the Republicans have accomplished! This is One country, not divided, however the democrats are still trying to fight against our elected President!
Sooo whats going on here,..?,... Is Nancy Pelosi there,.. She is hot,.. Anyways keep up the good work,..😒,..<~~~talking about the catering,.. Hah joke,.. Later guys,..👍😀
Cowbelly 2020
Trump is the greatest President ever! MAGA 2020!!
Garbage......
2:49:50 Trump : "African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded."

2:50:01 Black audience: *BUT WE WANNA BE KANGZ AND SHIET*
Clean..... Coal.....?
Look at all the triggered anti Trump snowflakes in the comment section lol!!!!!!! Trump 2020
Is it me or is Trump like the greatest president since Washington. USA FTW
By far the best State of the Union Address I've ever heard.
@2:40:50 is where the speech begins.
Pence frowns when he’s attempting a fake smile.
Mr. Ji Sung-Ho. 


I Salute You.
Chyna
the problem in Philadelphia Mr government the last name is Geiger this Geiger been on the run for twenty five years Philadelphia got the answer to the Geiger family problem
Pretty sure half of this video was people clapping.
And what was this all about? Seems that he is just stating random facts, what was the goal of this speech?
Joint chiefs didnt seem to be happy about nuke pile up idea
Why did it take 1 1/2 hours for this to start!?
Trump 2020!! Maga!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Just the wealthy people will love and like the tax cut,.
We, the hardworking ,low income salary will get credits for one or two years ,after will have to pay back ,INFLATION,INFLATION  !!
..
lots of Ritz biscuit
Finally, at 2hrs & 40 mins mark starts the speech!!
We demand change for the people at all cost
You lie!
Can the talking heads say anything good about our President? If Obama was giving the same speech they would be gushing!
Go to 2:20:20 in the video timeline to see the actual address
DEATH TO THE LEFT!
So 2 hours 50 minutes can be cut out of this
Just so you know, the dislikes are for NBC, not trump. Good speech, good president. Bad news source.
Such a great speech while the democrats are acting like their party symbol! 🐴 Lol
As a Black person I am so glad Black unemployment is down. The Black Caucus should have clapped.   Don't they want us having jobs and making a better life for ourselves?  Shame on them!!!!!
Good lord this guy is a bum!
It's funny how most of these drumpf supporters are so passionate about what they "believe" in but yet all of pictures that display they're all still in high school or foreigners which would easily support the idea of outside interference but you don't realize that because your blind arrogance doesn't allow you to see past the lies. Good luck
Jesus Christ did what no other human being has ever done or could ever do. He was the ONLY person on this planet who has never sinned. Because He has never sinned, He is the only acceptable sacrifice God the Father would accept to pay ransom payment for each of our sins. That is simply AMAZING isn't it? JESUS DID IT!! Seek Jesus Christ today and receive His FREE GIFT of eternal forgiveness and salvation. May God bless you in the glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. John 3:16 ❤️
1:32:09 is the start, REALLY!
President Trump stepped away from his life of wealth and comfort to serve the nation he loves. What a patriot! God bless President Trump.
Trump is the best president In years
Chuck Todd is a fool... Trump didn't mention Putin by name, but called out Russia and China @ 4:07:30
trash!
Looks like Kennedy is running for reelection. But, there was nothing he said that hasn't been said before. #lame
Lebertards re upset because they couldn't get the job done !  great job Mr President !!!!  A+
Pelosi was sucking on her dentures. But c'mon Dems. Why the perpetual pout? There is much to embrace in his speech, and the now sensible turn of the country. Very much of what he is saying is simple, common sensical, if one cares at all for the country, in its founding ideals, and cares enough to rid oneself of pernicious ideologies like communism, militant atheism and global sovereignty. Goodness already. May God bless America, again.
GO TRUMP! GO AMERICA! #MAGA
Donald Trump you need to bring in the administration many younger people so that they can make decisions for their generation as well. there should be mandatory retirement at 65 except for yourself.
Gotta love how difficult this is to find, since youtube pollutes the primary search results for the state of the union with liberal propaganda
Can someone educate me on who the two guys behind Trump are?
The Titanic has sailed! Thank Trump!
Mejor presidente es Trump.
It has to be a very miserable time for democrats and  liberals. The Democratic Party is out of power, and the economy is again booming at all record levels. Optimism and believing in America is again becoming a healthy theme. The overwhelming majority of Americans regardless of party don't support endless illegal immigration. Sorry to see that you're so miserable when America succeeds. I know it's all about just acquiring power, and not giving a hoot about the country's well being. Today's Democratic Party has no ideas, and their party leadership is beyond pathetic. Sorry folks, but Americans are tired of identity politics, endless taxes, America last, and all of the other useless garbage you offer.
If I was President, I would have Metallica open up for me!!! Get that mosh pit going!!!
TRUMP 2020. 👍👍🙌💪🇺🇸
Charater is like a pregnancy, you cannot hide it.
Governments don’t work in the best interest of the people. I don’t know how people still believe that governments care about the people. They never have and never will. It’s just the illusion that they do to keep the people from uprising. Wake up your mind. There is something very wrong with this world and the people or groups who are truly in charge. Everything is all about money and nothing else. Greed and corruption is all we will ever have.
VERY GOOD MR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!
Trump 2020
I love watching Pelosi play with her dentures.......classy!!!!
Come on, edit your video. Trim off that hour and a half of nothing at the beginning! I know that's because it was live and you wanted everything in place early but it isn't live now.
Fake news
#Fukushima says:  It ain't me; Twitter is the terrorist
State of the union was ok but that Kennedy was ridiculous. Seriously what a joke.
FAKE NEWS
Democrats cannot handle the truth that the economy is booming, companies are moving back to America and paying higher wages and bonuses. Democrats cannot handle the truth about the low unemployment numbers under Trump. Democrats cannot handle the truth that the Trump military has crushed ISIS in Iraq and Syria.Democrats cannot handle the truth that illegal border crossings are down 50%.
I got tired of winning.
if I hear that damned welding story one more time.. ive heard it from 3 different presidents
Democrats are at an all time low. This makes me want to be a republican in all honesty
SNL will do it better
Look at all these corrupt decrepit old men. The next generation will have to work hard to undo what these idiots have done.
2:40:00 that's when it actually starts.
Great speech President Trump!
It starts at 1:32:08
Seems to me from the look on Pelosi's face that Dems dont like to work "for the people." They prefer to work for themselves and the agenda that put them in the position they hold.
reduce the price of prescription drugs , dems don't likey.
Hah, says that isn't the Trump we are used to seeing... yet we only seem to see what the news wants us to see which is not that he is our strong and fearless president. Seriously, you can slander him all you want, but you only make yourself out to be the fake news we all know you are. 

But hey, at least you weren't like ABC and putting up slandering tweets during the speech. Bravo at not trying to be negative the whole time.

Before anyone asks why I watched this video, I'm watching them all for dish9nest reporting trying to paint a bad picture of this inspiration and heart felt speech. That way if anyone tries to argue, I can throw the fake news in their faces when they are proven wrong. Salt in the wound always feels nice when it is someone else ;)
i like how the right side stands up and down more than a catholic mass
What’s up with Barron?
dems get off the high horse, clap for something. sad that you guys cant get along.
Once more the sith will rule the galaxy.
Good speech
It starts at 2:40
WHY ARE THEY SHOWING DONALD TRUMPS FACE DONALD IS SYLISH I NO DONALD BUT DONALD TRUMP STYLIS I INDIA
if this was north korea they all would be clapping
RIP AMERICA
You have to skip near a whole two hours. Plus time skiping the Studio actors. Just to listen to the president.
The media is full of crap! The #metoo movement was started by the women who had been sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton!!!!!
4 MORE YEARS
That was a lot of people standing, clapping, sitting down, and then repeating a few seconds later. 

My palms and legs hurt, and I wasn't even there.
Democratic African Americans ALWAYS find some way in any situation with the president to make him seem racist when it really isnt
The speech was amazing
This guy had talk sooo sloooow to make sure he's reading the teleprompter right lol I'll give it to the guy, he can read on a 5th grade level. Good job MR. PUTOS
Disliked for the fake news propaganda, biased/hateful commentary and spin.
4:14:25 That guy looks like a Ginger Peeta from the Hunger Games
For everyone who wants to skip all the long bs and get to the actual event it’s at 2:35:00
FAKE NEWS.
Why is this on trending? It is so biased.
I think Kennedy needs a bib what's up with the spittle all over his mouth
*The thing you're here to watch is here*
2:40:53 








Thank me by liking this comment so others can find out
AW I LOVE TRUMP!!!!
''War on energy'' only a dummy would think that getting your country out oil and coal dependency is bad for your nation
I'm a Democrat and I voted for Trump.
Too many haters. But at least a normal person is our president. 😀
"BEAUTIFUL CLEAN COAL"
I see a bunch of salty faces in there.
African American, Hispanic american? What does that even mean. So we should call some European American, asian American? So what group should be called only Americans? Because not even the 1st known people that occupied this land are called Americans, instead they are called native Americans.
Proud to call this man my President. MAGA!!!!!
Ah how cute! Its a republicon circe jerk convention!
2:42:00 Why does this woman look so angry? Is she a democrat?
If seeing a Trump presidency makes the democrats angry, then seeing the Trump presidency actually doing well makes them LIVID.
Do your thing Mr.President!!! 👍🏼
slowly but surely, president trump will turn out to be the best president of the united state since Reagan, and maybe surpass him, in great acts and leadership.
Glad to be an American!
Great speach....maybe the democrats should take a slow boat to china...if they don't  like our president or country leave  there is no fence keeping you here, get out.... your a disgrace to a freely elected President and a country,  we are on our way  no thanks to you all
trump starts talking at 2:40:55 / 5:08:05
Americans ARE DREAMERS TOO!
I'm not a big Trump fan myself, but dam the Democrats look like someone just died lmfao chilllll
Good job very positive...
I loved Trump's speech it made me so happy, idk about others but I got a feeling when watching the speech that people where realizing that Trump is not as bad as they think he is.
C-SPAN's upload was better.
It's important to note that anytime NBC here doesn't pan over the Democrats, but only across the GOP and center, it's because just about every single Democrat is sitting down and not even clapping. When they pan over from a distance so that the two or three that stand up look more numerous, it's because they don't want you to see the real number sitting down and not clapping.
i wonder what hilliary would have said. not that it really matters. GO TRUMP!
Boss
Garbage president.
Donald Trump what a troll
Idk why but 2:50:02 made me laugh
The Democrats LOST the 2020 election on this faithful night!!!!!!!
Good speech
All empty promises that will not be fufilled
The red haired senator near the end is just a total fake.
I don't get the dislikes NBC is literally just showing a recording
MAGA
and this is really happening
https://youtu.be/2pmRkyNzLJc
The demonrats look so hateful! It shows the lack of caring and support that they dont have for the American ppl when they sit there stoned faced as the President gave a fantastic speech supporting America and looking out for America and they just sat there like imbeciles who dont have any brains or compassion for anyone or anything cept for their selfish agenda. They would of been better off to stay at home. They r pathetic!
Bernie tweeted during it, friggin loser
yes i agree those long face people need to get out of the way and let trump work.
Why news agencies do not listen to the voice of the Iranian nation. From the 1st of Bahman, the people of Iran start banging, hurling, whistling and cracking every day at 9.30-10.00. This is a protest against the regime of the dictator and terrorist organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Their leader is Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, and their group is called the "Restart".
Wait,This was 5 Hours,8Minutes and 5 sec OMGGG
Prez. Trump knows the weeyyyyy
I abstained from voting due to the circus antics displayed duringbthe primary and general elections. This is not the same Trump I saw during the elections. 

I lean right, but one of my biggest pet peeves was on immigration reform. I felt the Republicans wanted to kick everyone out and the Democrats wanted them to stay here but stay illegal... Like a sub class of people. I didnt fit in either group because no one ever talked about pathways to citizenship.

If he keeps this up and works on bridging the party gaps, he might just get my vote in the next election.
Speech was really great, as a proud Canadian, I am thankful we have a great neighbour with a truly great President.Mr Trump, you are an asset to  great America. Thank god you got elected.
It's sad to see Megan Kelly has been liberalized!  I used to really like her on Fox
Lol Mitch McConnell at 3:32:00
How is there so many dislikes yet every comment is pro trump #maga
Was awesome speech good job Trump
Trump is a hedgehog
It’s great having a businessman as President
It’s always been lawyers
I believe everyone in the room makes well over 300k lol !!!!
dear mr. trump,  you think you could run canada in your spare time.  trudeau  sucks
GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Panel discussion was brilliant. Notably, Scaramucci and David. Bravo, NBC, for bringing them all together.
Viva trump
NBCs commentators are biased garbage.
So happy to see so many in the comment section are awake to whats really happening. Golden age incoming. The swamp will be drained.
"The majority of the Monmouth survey was conducted before Trump’s State of the Union address. Instant reaction polls found the speech was well-received, with a CBS News survey finding that 75 percent approved." -The Hill
I am a American Dreamer ❤️
Trump is the Best & his State of the Union is Legendary 💘 
NBC, CNN ext. are Propaganda.
Fat Cats
Bigger Fish
The greatest speech ever. And to think he got so much done with these stinking democrats trying to stop him at every turn.
What a great President!!!!. Dear Amerca, I, as South Korean, so envy you that you are blessed to have such a great President.
Seems like the losers are the only ones that dislike Trump. They are so used to losing that they see no good in anything.
Pathetic liberal media just can't help themselves. LOL!
Make a comment, clap.  Make another comment, clap some more.  Why is *he* clapping?
fake news
Dems hate America
3:31:35 arrrrr security
Thank you Trump! from a hard working American
don't know whether to give a thumbs up for the speech or a thumbs down for the commentary...
Its cory in the house
this is proof democrats hate when blacks and minorities get jobs.
5:01:42 The moment you realize your comment sucks.
Its so funny with that dude that gets his "headache" pills taken away at 1:36:00 ... and then hes like "I need them" ... and the news lady "Sorry, you dont get it!" ... and then he goes silent... real silent ... with a rock hard facial expression... bet he was thinking "all right... guess they all think im an addict, WTF!"
XD
bias at all NBC. the democrats must be butt hurt still for losing and that trump is doing a lot better then they wanted. they barely even stood up. even talking about unemployment being at a all time low. the dems feed off people in the inner city's and the unemployed. keep it up trump
MAGA
This comment section is almost all centrist/right wing. Probably because leftists usually just watch the highlights.
Liberal tears keep this country running smooth
Trump winning & winning & winning & we say stop trump in tired of winning & trump says!!!!NOOOOOOO WE GONNA KEEP WINNING & TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AGAIN 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
i  hope  he'll lose  these  both  houses  in November!
and he'll lose them  badly!
Petulant children pouting in the corner...
Hispanics cats like me love President Trump.We're tired of the small crumbs thrown by those Democrats who sit on their hands when we need real change in the real world. Viva Trump!
3 of the most disgusting bigots of all times, Swamp monster - Ryan, Christian bigot - Pence - and racist misogynistic Psychosis trump
Chuck Todd called MS13 immigrants “mythical” at the end, wow, truly ignorant and poorly-biased. An no surprise Megyn Kelly is talking about his clapping and length instead of the message, as if she mentioned Obama’s LONG pauses between every 5 word phrase haha. Someone has to get them out of the media
It should not matter how they feel personally about President Trump they could at least show support for the many accomplishments that have produced amazing results for the American people; Goes to show these Democrats are in it for themselves only and have no cares for the average American
Watching from Germany! Great president wonder speech
After 8 years of the clown show and circus of the Democrats, this is so refreshing to hear. Grateful we can finally win again as a nation. Go Trump!
2:36 and so far, only NBC talking heads
●Best State Of The Union, EVER!
Democrats look so butt hurt lol I love this man
Way to go president Trump!

THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud "holy water in God's hands" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit.

Awesome president and speech!!!! So glad people are speaking out now about this great president of the United States of America and becoming proud of the American Heritage again!!
I still cant help to laugh when I see Trump as president of USA. Feels like a satiric comedy....
Not sure whether to like for the President or dislike for NBC
I actually was really impressed! The entire speech! First time I actually watch the Entire State Of The Union Address too! All I can say to our wonderful government employees-the Dems ....are such terrible employees. And we PAY THEM...If I owned a company and paid them, they would no longer be on my payroll, and I would have kicked them out of my meeting! The difference WOW LOL They really, really need to learn the Economic system they work for CAPITALISM! They seem to forget THAT IS AMERICA!
#releasethememo and watch the Democratic house of cards fall!
Oh my NBC having a bias opinion?! What breaking news..

Stock market increase artificial. Interest rates are rising. Great time to rent. Forget borrowing to buy a house. Trump got rich on real estate. So the tax plan benefits his clients
The peacock is a Satanic symbol....How befitting of NBC.
The dollar is sinking
How do you explain to clients raising prices?
Wow what are the odds: Dems loosing it all, Memo coming out, SOTU, on garbagetruck in middle of nowhere on the tracks, train with congresmembers rashes into it....
NBC is disgusting.  I’m so excited to see how much of a joke leftists are becoming.  The right to young people is now becoming cool and the left is becoming a pathetic joke.  A new brand of proud Americans are making themselves known!
Americans are Dreamers too.  They are not "mythical criminals".  They are very real, and include every single invader who came across the border illegally.
Everything is more expensive
People getting richer in the stock market, or dollar getting weaker?
Dear god could you get anymore annoying and bias.
Looser Dems can't stand for the flag, black jobs, capital & founders, more jobs, etc. Sad! Great speech just too long. MAGAZINE
Fake news instead of getting hint and produce better news, gets faker.
Trump never addressed inflation or a shrinking dollar
Cigarettes butts are missing these butt holes
Who wrote the speech?
devil in disguise..
well trump is definentily racist now that he pointed out a wife officer for something he did that was good
Love Bernie Sanders
after watching this video, seeing the faces, and seeing the lack of enthusiasm, i’m certain democrats hate America
Check out this app 👉    https://sweatco.in/i/daniel666230 ... It pays for walking

#americansaredreamerstoo . :)
Such a great speech by a great president! Trump is doing great things for Americans and the democrats hate it! #boycottthedemocrats
And Kennedy trying to follow the president... wow. That was completely unnecessary rhetoric after a lengthy and inspiring speech. You’ve got a long way to go dude. Stupid speech.
WINNING!
Schumer just needs to up and die already. He looks like an effing mob boss who just needs to be offed.
I'll sub to everyone who subs to me!
democrats made  a big fool of them selfs //now there trying too get all the people too pay attention too joe kennedy the 3rd //they think that if they get him into the house then he will  then  take down trump and republicans in the seats //what they don't know a lot of these young kids today is that ted kennedy left a innocent women pregnant with hi baby under water in a car too drown too death //the kennedys  have killed and been in jail and done all kinds of stuff like the Clintons //they have a bad name from way back from ted kennedy //why would any one want people like this guy joe kennedy the 3rd in the wh //just more trouble on America//he will bring in more illegals like Obama //since ted kennedy  and Obama became good friend with Hillary and bill //because ted kennedy train fraud Obama back in 2006 2007  2008 too run the wh //and then later on ted kennedy died //and look how fraud arab muslim Obama ran the wh along with muslim Valerie jarret and  criminal Hillary Clinton//USA was a mess for 8 years  bring in nothing but criminals of illegals//democrats are a disgrace on America
Trump has only been in office for a year and he is already my favorite President in my lifetime.
Lol NBC! Your own programming is trash. “Too much applause”, “Not memorable”, “Speaking to his base”. He’s addressing the nation. That’s his base! We the people applaud progress unlike you cynical, miserable people.
Look at these triggered liberals. They will never accept the FACT that Trump is on his way to monumental success. He's already on pace to exceed Reagan, and STATISTICS back that up! Not feelings, STATISTICS. Look up that word "statistics"  before you make yourself look foolish on my comment you misinformed liberals 😂
Not going to say youtube is a reliable source of information in regards to the populace supporting Trump but an overwhelming amount of likes should say something.
Patriotism is the last refuge
The statist presstitutes try so hard to spin this and fail.  < Break > Is this Kennedy ginger drooling?
The democratic response was worthless.... truly worthless
I just need one more sub to reach 10, can I please get some help from my fellow people with a sub?
inspiring,  great job
Sell the drip Trump!
Uniom
Nothing about mass school shootings and domestic terrorism.biggest mass shooting in Vegas with Paddock ,
Hillary Clinton
Go Trump!
all the down votes is for this video feed, the 1st 1.5 hours show nothing, then the next 1 hour NBC talking heads bad mouth the president, and they think their so clever. MSM is going down.  the president starts talking at 2:38:22
update: I see they snipped off the portion off the video that I was talking about. MSM always making their lies disappear.
Alright scared kittens. Back into your party corner with your hair standing on end, and stick up your tail for your congressman to stick his junk up your derriere for another term so we can get rid of all the dangerous drugs, illegals, and terrorists forever, and ever, and ever
2:47:46... Nacy Pelosi looks upset. She is like I want better better president. This president is weak.
Legendary
List of positive accomplishments Donald trump has carried out in his presidency:
-an all right SOTU speech 
- *space filler*
- *space filler*
- *space filler*
Trump is my president
As a former Democrat, I have to say that it is shocky how far the Democratic party has taken it. Not honoring those who serve and sacrifice for our country is despicable! Shame on them!
So serious question, Trump seems to have given the "dreamers" a way forward with Amnesty and so on. Why are democrats upset by this? Or what are they actually mad at? Please don't comment some identity politics bs. I wnt a legit reason why they disagree.
Democrats pulling out their diversity and inclusion by tapping the whitest CIS male they could find.
a long but great speech!! let me know belw what you thought about this speech last night.  hey if not any hassle please consider checking out my youtube page, ill also subscribe to anyone who subscribes to me as well. thank you mushlove

Never in my life I saw a more stupid president than Trump.
He is a really asshole> remove him before he destroys earth.
You don t know how dangerous he is.
Stupid yankees who voted on a lunatic>> find out for yourselve.
...can they repeat 1 more time how there's a special investigation going on when the media wouldn't bring up Hilary being under criminal investigation ONE GOT DANG TIME.
Its sad that the democrats will not stand for amazing statistical facts that are bettering our country. Isn't that what both parties are for, the betterment of America our great nation?
What a pep rally!!!
BREAKING NEWS: Train carrying GOP members of Congress to WV retreat has crashed....anyone find that timing suspicious?

I lost it ... "Ken/Can Bone" laughing my a$$ off. How did Kornaki hold it together? Even Kornaki was asking why would his parents name him that #METOOMOVEMENT. FAKE NEWS! TRUMP TRAIN 2020!
I clicked on thumbs down not because of the speech but because of the negative commentary which started from the beginning. Right from the start the bias of the commentators shined through as they immediately brought up the Russian scandal that NO-ONE cares about except for the mainstream news media, and that because they skew the truth and push the agenda. Trump gave a GREAT speech and hit the right topics. All I hear from him is “we” can do it and “America” first. As a citizen of this great country that is what I want to know that my elected officials are focusing on...US...CITIZENS! Everything else is secondary because the government is elected by us for us. If you can’t see that I feel for you.
NBC - Nothing But Crap - #MarkDice 😀👍
Idk if I should thumbs down for nbc or thumbs up for trump
NBC you do realize that most people who are free thinkers; are knowing that your views are that of a demented, vile, evil Mr. Rodgers from demolition man .  Where you want the dems candyland of Django to continue.  Where you want to be the Stanley Tucci charactor in the hunger games . Where we ordinary people are treated as cattle . No wonder you earn the label of Nothing But Crap network.
Can’t wait to vote for trump again in 2020!👍🏼🇺🇸
2:40:00. Want something done do it yourself.

As a black man i suppose to hate trump. But I thought his speech was great. Sorry just being honest
Joseph Kennedy ! What economic increase have you provided for the American experience in your service to the people of America ? THE answer for you is NADAT . The Dems are the Biggest Bullies on the Block .
Hope for USA, despair for Canada. What a difference a leader makes. Canada does not have a leader but a little boy. Actions speak louder than words.
😭
Well done Mr President!  Excellent delivery!
Trump / Pence 2020! Many MAGA Promises Kept! Trump to Win 45 of 50 states again in 2020? YES!
I literally can not disagree with one thing this guy says.
NBC tried from the get-go to shame Trump when he entered 😂 You just signed a 7 year extension 👍

i think that pre SOTU approval rating is deflated by the media.
So are they not able to afford a video editor to remove 1hour + of nothingness???
Yay Trump!
What sorry news commentators on the speech of The President ! If these news commentators do not like the coal which heat , cool and light their homes with the savings coal gives them . Then you heed to cut your utilities off !
First time I've seen Mad Dog smile. Beautiful speech. Beautiful.
The Russian Bots are out in force on this one.
The downvotes are because this was originally a 5hr. video where NBC anchors bashed America and our president for four hours straight. They cropped it afterwards to make it look like the speech was hated. Terrible. Fake news.
Fantastic speech and better than that, he just doesn't talk...he acts on our behalf!
MAGA! My downvote is because this is NBC and they are trash lol
keep doing what ur doing Trump we still r right beside you $$$$$
☆☆TRUMP☆☆
So tired of the media. I generally just change the channel on you.
Good old Megan!!!
I hope Embarrassment-in-Chief enjoyed delivering his LAST State of the Union address.

Look at all them bad hairs/ wigs
Can’t believe he brought the victims family in the fuel the hatred for illegal immigrants- that seems crazy

i wonder why Dumbocrats can't comprehend what fake news is when they hear it   ??
Beautiful clean coal  😂
How much crap do I need to sit through to just watch the speech if I were to watch this on TV lol.
He changed my mind I think he did a great job the media is really showing its bias.
What a terrible broadcast by NBC. The people who were clapping are almost never seen they had to cut to the group who weren't clapping almost everytime. Time for a new TV director NBC because yours sucks big time.
Starts at 2:40:14 Your welcome
im so light right now ok ok ok!!!
we so lit!
dab like this!
Speech starts at 2:40:51
Wouldn't it be nice if the USA just shut off itself from the rest of the world, like Japan did for 260 years? Mentality-wise 50% already did......Only America here, only America there.......god, so much time wasted on singing once own praises.......and most of all on applause. 80% of the "speech" are republicans applauding. Well, americans, you did this to yourself......
"We" over 100 times...."Us" over 100 times....."I" only 29 times.
Loved his speech I got emotianal, I am very proud to be AMERICAN!
He stole DACA from them miserable sobs and look at all those racists/ Democrats they're fresh out of ammunition for political gain in 2020 nothing but greed and evil on the faces of the Democratic party. It was sickening to watch how unamerican they really were!!!
Thank you for having the courage to lead the possibility for this country to always be free!
Extremely biased media.. It's very unfortunate that I cannot trust NBC to bring me the news anymore without soaking it in their propaganda and biased agenda...The more I watch this the sicker I feel knowing that these people are dividing our country purposely...and they sit their and smugly grin like they are doing us all a favor.
NBC.... (sigh) The American people, your audiance does NOT like Bias news!!! (Negative stories do get higher ratings) but what we do not like is lies, distorted or absent facts, and FAKE NEWS!!! Just put out the facts....ALL of the facts and you will have great ratings.... And you wounder why FOX News kills all other news outlets in the ratings!?!  Learn from the compitision!!!
Fast forward to 2:40:49
Fun Fact they clapped over 120 times :D
DemoCraps arent anti-TRump..........they are Anti American!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#MAGA #WINNING
God these anti-trump people can’t get over the fact he won. They nit-pick little details and blow them up like the worst thing ever, and yet they avoid all the positive things he’s done
Love this President.  Make America Great Again.
So is there no other gangs besides MS13, what about the gangs in Chicago, New York, and Detroit, they were formed in the United States, are you gonna ignore them and just blame it all on one specific gang
Republicans bring everyday Americans and heros to the speech and democrats bring illegals to the speech as their guests.  I guess we know who their priority is.   Someone should tell them that this is the US congress not Mexican congress.   This was the greatest speech since Ronald Reagan.  I only wish they would come here to California and rescue us from these democratic idiots who have ruined this great state.
She's a PUSHER, Katey. A pusher.
Great speech by a great president, and give up on the fake Russian Collusion. There are no facts, so drop it. Use your brain
Just skip the editorializing and watch the SOTU
Grab that P...y and s...hole country.  Mexico will pay for the wall (like never).  Lol
State of the Union starts at 2:06:00

2:40:33 for those who are really late like me.
"Whoever believes that they don't have problems in their marriage..." Who was this guy? He was speaking some truth
Interesting why this video has 1hr32 min and 35 seconds of just an ad banner and the rest of the time is filled up with banter untill the president starts speaking at 2hrs 50min and 55 seconds on this 5hr video.
A Nation Trump wants America to be seems to be one sold to Putin for the exclusive benefit and comfort of Trump, his family, and political stooges in the congress and those directly doing his bidding.  Period!  

I don't even understand why the Democratic Responses to his Speech did not mention his persistent efforts to demoralize the FBI.  Trump's call for bipartisan consensus policies is a big lie.  He never would go by that. We have seen him walk back from similar promises in recent past.  He only said that in his Speech to make him appear humane or collaborative to the World.  

People should take cues from his assertion that he would rather have his Secretaries reserve the right to filter various Institutions of Government to suit his whims. That was a hint to justify what he has been doing, and want to continue doing to  the FBI and other Federal Institutions that have the potential to expose his flawed Campaign and governance. If he really wants bipartisanship  to prevail in making decisions, he should immediately repudiate the GOP denial of Democrats the chance to present their versions of the concocted Nunes Memo which harms the FBI. 

The Republicans being prone to cooking up stuff in secret, and not allowing Democrats any opportunity to review or present an option is not bipartisan.
Leftist ideology is a failed ideology. It creates poverty & misery for all. Look at all the states run by Democrats. They tax the crap out of everyone then wonder why everyone's leaving...

DUMBING DOWN OF AMERICA ,,, FOOLS THE WORLD CAN SEE THESE LIERS WHY CAN'T YOU OPEN YOU F$CKING EYES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was so refreshing to hear a President that can actually speak.  The last  8 years under Obama was so painful with is inept ability to speak without saying "UH" every 3 words and his inability to not whistle every 6 words.  You could tell Obama  was a 'C' student in speech class.  Of course if he hadn't spent every day stoned on Maui Waui, he might have learned to actually use the ENGLISH language.
Even democrats stand ,nice :)
It feels so good to be an American again.
An hour and a half of nothing, what a waste of bandwidth..
This guy needs to wipe the corners of his mouth
Bernie Sanders what a troll
The beginning coverage was ridiculously anti-trump. Wow. NBC is ridiculous. America LOVES Trump. The media is completely disrespecting our President and yet his speech is all about giving honor where honor is due.
Starts @ 2:38:15
Democrats are an effing disgrace
I respect the president no matter who it is
thought it was a good speech.
Hold your applause til the end please....
Is also kinda dissapointing that the presidents dont write their own speeches
A liars State of the Union....
God bless America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Reminds me of Emperor Neron
“Christian” Republicans disappoint me. Actually just politics/society in general disappoint me. And this is coming from a Christian man. My views are to treat EVERYONE with love—that means whoever is in need, give, and vice versa. People value the wrong things these days—a lot of things that we care about like law abiding “illegal immigrants” are so twisted. And if you’re not Christian, don’t comment because you probs won’to understand where I’m coming from.
2:40:54 Actual speech start time.
Time to change parties! I didn't vote for Trump but I most certainly will next time (hoping he goes for a second term). I will be enjoying the lower taxes and not having to pay a  huge no healthcare penalty from Obama. Trump's kept a lot of campaign promises I never heard on the news. I just wish he would show more couth with his words overall.
So nice to have a real President in the Oval Office.  The silent majority is with you Trump.  2020 is yours TRUMP.
Trump is a fool and a pathological liar!
We love our President. MAGA!
NBC News sucks, and the dislikes show it. When will the democrats stop being so but hurt.
Just three more years, right?
When Nixon was told it was time to leave in 1974, it was the Republicans who were at the forefront of that momentous decision and they were Patriots to be sure.
But today's Republicans such as Devon Nunez and of all people, Paul Ryan. are actively participating in the cover up. 
They want to impede the Mueller investigation by any means necessary. 
Time and history will bear all this out.
2:53:42 *"Opama Care"*
Yea, NBC you blew it.
So many people tend to focus on the negatives, and block out the positive things that have happened through the Trump administration like a bunch of ignorant children holding their hands over their ears going “lalalalala not listeninggg”
This lifelong Democrat LOVES Trump!!! Thank you, Mr. President, for supporting the Constitution, for keeping us out of the TPP, for exposing the extreme corruption in Washington, and for supporting American workers and family farms. A strong economy and putting Americans first is vital to our success as a nation. Now, if you can help us transition into a clean and green energy future (supporting a healthy environment and food supply), you will be remembered as one of the greatest presidents in US history. Great job, Mr. President!
Notice how the black democrats sat when Trump mentioned how black unemployment is lower than it has ever been, makes one question if they really care about the black voter. It looks like they prefer to keep the black man oppressed so they can promise them a better future, Trump is delivering that better future. Talk is cheap democrats but action speaks to the people...
@ 2:59:50

YAY! We all must believe in a magic man in the sky!
Maga
"State of the UnioM" Joke.  Nonsense.  I'll watch elsewhere.
The best President I have seen in my lifetime and the worst media I have ever seen in my lifetime. If you disagree with the sotu address by Trump then you are anti-American.
Ya I had to skip almost 3 hours of fake news to get to my Presidents State of the union address!!!
lmao. All the African Americans .... not a smile on their faces.
The Globalist and Satanist are not happy! Just look at thier faces.
Outstanding President and the best State of the Union ever! You  trump haters can't deny how much better our Country is for this man! Wake up and join the movement!! We all live in this Country and NEED to take it back as ours!!
Thumbs up for Trump's speech, thumbs down for the constant negative commentary.

NBC, you are an absolute disgrace.
trump says something -> crowd cheers -> trump says another sentence -> crowd standing up and cheers. hard to take it seriusly, looked more like a talkshow to me..
Great speech, but NBC is garbage...
It is not shocking that the Con-serving-thieves would flock in droves behind the Con-In-Chief.  To them money and wealth are all that matter.  In fact, it is Money they worship. Not God.  They only draw on the benign, empathetic, humane message from the Lord to soften their targets for easy prey. 

So, when Putin eventually found the right weaponry to ravage the USA's enviable Democratic System, with his quasi-Capitalistic Oligarchic window dressing and Cyber-intrusion to skew the Elections for his stooge, these 'children of the dirty bloody purse' were all for it and could not care.  But the benefit to them could only be best seen as transient, while the harm to the USA lingers for long.   

It is most shameful that  the GOP are so obsessed with the lure of the shady tax break and its expected huge 'margin of profit' to their leaders and financiers that they have blocked their shared obligation to protect the Democratic Institutions of America.  So. long as they get richer, why should they care about Democracy?  If the Russians would always hang around to help them win the Elections to keep their majority in Congress and the Presidency, why should they concern themselves with stopping the Russians?  They would rather go after any other American or entity, like the FBI, that attempts to be a hindrance to their newly formed  alliance with Putin's Russia.  

They have the Devlin Nuneses,  Jim Jordans, and Paul Ryans to lead the surreptitious, political cannibalization of the FBI and fellow Americans.  But they must hold on to that tight because when the tides turn against them, they would be sent into the dark pit of political obscurity unimaginable.  All the Billions of dollars from the Kocchs, Adelsons and Mercers cannot pull them up from that pit any time soon, God willing.
seriously? You couldn't cut the bumper music?
Should I like it because it's trump or dislike because it's NBC?
Are these reporters???
why cant uk have Balls like trumps new America looks like usa is back on the juice.
3:10:09 Sour grapes
Another win for trump. He can lose.
So many misinformed tools just hating on Trump b/c he is MAGA.  Trevor Noah & the rest of you liberal losers get over yourselves already!
Funny how Obama's speeches were all over the trending feed but with Trump...Buried! All the videos have plenty of views to be there but, nodda! YouTube censorship.
Poor liberals.  Still whining about Queen Hillary's loss.
America always win ... Glad I American saved our lives many many years ago ..
Speech actually begins at 2:40:50
I HOPE THEY SEARCHED THE ILLEGALS FOR WEAPONS
LOL All the little Hillary supporters giving this a thumbs down.  So Sad LOLOLOLOLOL
The auto industry never brought back jobs even though bailed out. Now they are coming back due to less taxation under Trump administration.
Finally a beautiful first lady , as little as a year ago we had what appeared to be a black woman .
We traded a first lady that loved to twerk on ellen to a classy beautiful first lady .
8 trillion dollers
Brokaw's comments are an indication of his negative bias.
Anyone seen Hillary ?
He didn't even acknowledge his own wife.
Do y'all see demon!
He is a great President.  I hope his bills get passed, we build the wall to secure our borders from the gangs that are involved in drug trafficking and murdering Americans.

NBC is terrible. Nancy Pelosi can't even agree people should come together. Wow she looks sour. She's done.
NBC deleting comments? 
All these views and 656 comments? 
Trump nailed this, and did it with facts. Congrats to all newly-employed, newly-inspired Americans, working for a better tomorrow. GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES!
Great speech by Trump. But you have to give credit where credit is due. That democratic guy who did the response is a great speaker.
If it wasn't for the Super Bowl Id never watch NBC again...

I love seeing all these positive comments on Trump. Trump 2020.
Trump threw a lot of "digs" at folks during that speech.....LOVE IT.
All the thumbs down are from California.
I will believe when it happens that I won't pay a arm and a leg in taxes and that I don't have to have crap insurance that does me no good  and I can use the money to pay my bill.
Is there an editied version without the phoney constant clapping??? They are clapping after every paragraph and probably takes an hour! Friggen frustrating!
AMERICA HAS A REAL PRESIDENT.  HAS DONE FIVE TIMES MORE GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN FAMILY IN ONE YEAR,  THEN OBAMA AND HIS LIES DID IN EIGHT YEARS.
"lowest unemployment in 45 years" WTF?? Who is writing your speech Mr. Trump? THAT is a lie and false statistics. This is so full of lies and propaganda it makes me barf!
I'm surprised so many elected black officials hate this country so much, yet 45 is the one bringing their people up from poverty - ironic.
Guys have faith in the President and our American system, we've got the best system in the world.
Properly the best speech in modern history. US entire manufacturing industry coming back in record time. Amazing what Trump has done. Wish he was our president greetings from Denmark.
NBC is going down because of their unjust slant
USA is dead
Love him, love, love him!!! Thank you, God for President Trump!!!!!!
I'm not much for politics but this just showed me that Dems don't give a crap about the American people.
I can’t stand these ridiculous talking heads... These people are gross ... The comments these hosts continue to spew is disgusting...
Excellent Speech Trump 2020. Screw fake news media
Where’s the diversity?  All I see is old fat white people clapping. Except for one complicit Carson, Chao and Haley. I noticed Rubio wasn’t clapping. Sad.
Yep ! But EMT's make minimum wage along with other health Care Workers . Shameful Hippocrates all of them
And for you liberals out there the world doesn't revolve around California and New York City. Check the map in between it's Trump country!
Thumbs down to NBC news for it's coverage of the address. It's a bunch of liberals who still can't face reality. President Trump is the leader of this nation get over last year's election. Most of the people on the cast sounded like a heartbroken teenage girl talking about an ex boyfriend. Liberals like y'all are the reason I'll never ever vote Democrat and I'm a moderate independent voter.
We expect reciprocal fair trade? What does the US produce that any other country can't produce better with more reliablity? Our GDP is war and imperialism.

But on the note of fair trade, does this mean that DJ has had a change of heart on TPP?
NBC is cancer.
All people of all color and creeds. Support your champion! A Elite that fights the elites!
Poor Bernie. 
The only real honest politician!
Trump for the people! All people! Screw the Liberal elites!

Hardly any minority in that room. I guess " diversity" doesn't evenly branch out to many areas of the nation.
Trump2020 umad
My, what delusional and disconnected commentary from your reporters. It's no wonder why NBC has worse ratings than public access channels. You are prime example of what happens when an organism fails to adapt. Keep up "the good fight" it won't last much longer.
beautiful clean coal.  #facepalm
The Dems are a bunch of USA hating C*NTS
The commentators clearly had nothing to complain about. 
Chuck: "Muh mythical immigrant criminal." *ignores grieving parents of murdered daughters by illegals*
Megyn: "He was clapping for himself! Grrrr." (not that he was clapping along with the people or clapping for the country or the people he was honoring)
Look at the way the female host treats Anthony Scaramucci as a guest on the panel.. NBC is an embarrassment
If you have a twitter account go get the MEME at the top of this page > 8ch(dot)net/qanon
Trumps statement that the first $24,000 for a married couple is tax free.  It was $20,800 previously - it's not that big of a deal like he's trying to make it out to be.  Plus he has taken away many items one could use to itemize.  

"The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank in Washington D.C., calculated that parents of 10 million children would qualify for an additional refund of just $75 or less under the committee's deal."   Oh gee, a whole $75.00.  And Trump try's to make it sound like we're all going to be rich!
We finally have a President that work for America!   Whooo TRUMP 2020!
the Democratic response from Kennedy was cringe.  He said we sacrificed Dreamers..as Trump actually is giving them all a path to citizenship lol.
Great speech! #MAGA
Man the mouth breathers really crawled out of their holes for this comment section. It is painfully obvious to anyone that is paying attention that Trump is an embarrassment to the USA. Try to look at this objectively. I am not a leftist. Trump's buffoonery on Twitter and uncouth behavior shows that he has no grasp of the proper decorum that is necessary to hold the highest job in the USA. He is a terrible diplomat, and he has completely taken the reigns off of the EPA. The lack of care he shows for the environment and for poor and elderly Americans is only outweighed by the extreme care he took in attempting to pass legislation that would only further the massive wealth disparity in the country. He is looking out for the best interests of the rich, plain and simple.
RELEASE THE MEMO AND THEN YOU WILL SEE SOME SAD LIBERAL FACE'S
Awesome speech, Mr. President. Now, let the fun begin. Release the memo. Arrest the bad guys. See you later Nancy and chuck. Have a real nice life in prison.
It’s really disappointing that the other side of the aisle cannot stand and celebrate something like veteran healthcare. Instead they just sit on their phones and chat with one another while The President of the United States is speaking. So disrespectful.
Liar, liar pants on fire:     http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tax-plan-doubled-standard-deduction-2017-9
Starts around the 2hour37min mark. Its just like in the movie "Head of State" the left wont move for the Right :P Good speech, watch out for that cockmeat sandwich at gitmo boys :P
I hate this liar.  And look at all his despicable supporters - so freaking clueless and believing all his lies.  You are stupid people.  Stupid, stupid people.  Sad times for the U.S.
Maggot Smelly, looks like such a used up rag. Sheesh.
NBC posts a 5 hour stream so that no one can tell what actually happened LOL.
America needs to be very very worried. This whole speech was just about North Korea. Bush did the same exact thing before Iraq. There is already talk of a premitive, bloody nose strike.. the north Korea defector, praising Mathis all this evidence. And Victor Cha seals it. Apparently they wanted Cha to help with an evacuation plan of Americans in Seoul South Korea. This really was the calm before the storm. Just a matter of when. https://www.vox.com/world/2018/1/30/16953558/state-of-the-union-trump-north-korea.
LOL... these manipulative NBC camera-men. You can fool the brain dead democunts but you can't fool the rest of us.
Pelosi looked like she'd just chowed down on a bag full O' Hot Turds
Black's are Destroying the Democratic Party ! And the Republican's are watching it happen ! lol
Such a surreal moment in history. If you took a time machine back to 2015 and showed them this, they would freak out
eww, how gross, i thought i was getting a professional show. moving on.
It's all "fake news" LMAO
Never before have I been so moved by a SOU address God Bless you president trump and God bless America 🤘🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

I hate how the hosts were so pessimistic and down,as if they were paid Democratic employees.Is not the news supposed to be objective???
fantastic speech,trump fricken rules.facts speak for themselves.
After seeing how the democrats sat though things no one should not support I can not see how any democrat could get reelected.
In God we trust.
You look at them Dems and realise that they already lost the 2020 election !!!
Trump is killing it right now, bout to drop that new FISA joint, poppin off.
NBC sucks peckers. #notfakenews
North Korea is leftist fascism. Following in the steps of Stalin, Pol Pot. Without a gun, Kim Jon Un means nothing. Meaning of fascism, futuristic nonsense. North Korea's denial of defeat has caused millions so much pain
They sure do like to clap for themselves. Is that a tradition or something?
I'm South African, but I just want to get up from my desk and chant USA! USA! USA! This guy is better than even Reagan
pus hypocrite 15 yrs of hard labour but how much creatures have the trade blockades culled
Your speech is full of hypocrisy. The people in the country you rule or divided because of your big fat mouth. ! You've done nothing to unify the people who contribute to making this county -a  good county.! As a result, you will go down as the most hated president in history. !!!!
Unless you're an illegal immigrant (and your opinion doesn't count) how can anyone not like all the incredible things happening to our country? Yay Trump! I'm so pleased with him!
Screw nativist entitlement mentality from anybody not red
Great speech Mr President !! MAGA !!
State of the Union Address Starts at 4:13:07

The fear mongering, that is not the Trump the people voted for
Trump is a dope !! Unite us as a country stop dividing us we are stronger together....I'll believe Trump when he tweets about unity

Why in the land of the free and the home of the BRAVE am I supposed to be so scared of terrorists and Mexican gangs
30 seconds in, and I can't even.
It’s sad how my fellow Americans can be so stupid to follow this moron Donald. The majority of this comment section is Russian bots. It’s sad this guy is our president, American is going down into the shithole thanks to Trumf
Kennedy race baiter...poor speaker. Negative after so much positive!
why so many times of sniffing thought?
By the way was Nancy having denture problems or was that nasty Demon just trying to get out of her.  Guess she held it in..
Seems like there in the basement. These people are reporters?
So proud to be an American right now! #MAGA 🇺🇸🇵🇷
um, that guy giving the democrat response was gross! was that Conan O'brien?  sweatmouth little boy
3:09 this guy is a demagogue... a fool... worthless...

Trump 2020
F them. put a thumbs up everyone!
Greatest American president since Lincoln. And he's only getting started.
NBC is such a huge bunch of eff tards... 2:55:00 chuck todd is worthless...
Why would you dislike this
You're welcome, scared kittens. Sponsored by the Republicans. Now back into a corner with your hair standing up on end with your tail straight up. 

In God We Trust? In God we Feeeeeeaarrrrrr🤤🤤🤤🤤
i like trump
1:51:57    In GOD We Trust
A terrific speech after a terrific year, well done sir.
Why does the Black Congressional Caucus look so mad when Trump mentions that black unemployment is at the lowest rate ever? 1:41:50
PLEASE. Y WONDERFUL PRESIDENT TRUMP, STOP CHEMTRAILS.
Donald Trump lies like a machine.
Fake
You guys know you can cut out that hour and a half of nothing, right?
groveling to the establishment
The NBC bias hatred is pathetic. It never ends!
#release the memo...not a russian bot..
Steady stream of xenophobia
BE VERY VERY SCARED🤤
"In God we trust". Most of the democrats sit down. This is the core of the problem.
Millions of people lost their health insurance.
Republicans clap.
Americans ARE dreamers to !  When you are a kid, you're a kid and American kids have lots of dreams, I did.  They are more important to me than children from other countries.  All children are important but my Grandma used to say, "Charity begins at home".  There are too many hungry kids in our country to prioritize on immigrant children.
The speech, while I never voted in a federal election, was almost brilliant. Still being a demagogue. Can't vote for a second term. Too much fear mongering, which is destroying America
I had to tap dislike 10 times before it worked, like that's not done on purpose... Crooks.
Lol oh man every time he stops speaking they give him a standing ovation. It’s so pathetic lol😂😂😂😂😂😂
same old stank lines with fake jobs figures and all the rest
The President has an incredible speech.
applaud every word same as 1940s sitcom
Even as a moderate liberal I can say this was a well done speech. 




I still dislike him.
looks lame as sub sahara afro union speech
did see mnuchin- hahahhahhahahhahahhahahhahahhahahahhahh karate frog
Great speech and great for America should think all loyal americans feel it, shame the Democrats show themselves as such poor representatives of the people disgraceful conduct and shame on them
NBC = Nothing But Crap
The little snowflake making the rebuttal looks like he is about to cry.....
Trump is such a liar! We happen to STILL be the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Maybe if 86% of the republican tax cuts didn't go to the top 1% we'd take your tax cut a little more seriously. Our country is wealthy enough! What we need to do is spend our tax money better. A little less on our military. We need to not waste money on a useless border wall. We need billionaires and large corporations  to start paying their fair share in taxes. Our government is run by thieves, liars and *ss holes right now. If we followed leaders like Bernie Sanders we would see the middle class grow, poverty shrink, and opportunities rise! Healthcare is a human right! Climate change is real and catastrophic! We are not a "christian nation", we are a nation of freedom, diversity and immigration!
That's our president! This what a president is! He is out for America! NBC commentary was thrash. 2020 president Trump!!!
And all this was done despite democrats obstructing this administration at every possible opportunity, and in the face of mainstream media ceaselessly slandering the man, his vice president, his staff, his daughter, his wife, his son in law, his grandson, etc.
Proud of the president
Thanks president
Democrats long faces are funny
It's very telling when trump acknowledged that African American and Hispanic unemployment is at an all time low and just about every Democrat stayed seated!! And you still think they care about you huh?
Is it really necessary to clap every 3 sentences? Is there actually anything of true substance being said here?
Poor Bernie =( 2:09:00
NBC, you are intolerable. Two mentions of Trump under investigation, heavy emphasis on your ridiculous narrative that is itself being exposed for the straight up corruption that it is. Even as it winds down to embarrassment for all perpetrating it. No, NBC, YOU are under investigation, that is the real story of great importance that is occurring right now behind the scenes with this. You persist in misleading your viewers to the very end, even as you go down with your stinking corrupted ship. 

We are getting our news elsewhere. You are no longer reliable, if you ever were. Nobody sensible watches your malevolent corrupted stupid sh|t anymore. You dug this miserable hole for yourselves and like pigs you wallow in it.

Beautiful speech. Excellent point throughout. 

Now brace yourselves as your sh|t hits the proverbial fan. You're going down. The Nunes memo is only the begging to the documents they summarize. The entire auditors findings, all two million pages! And the process is ineluctable. 10X worse than Watergate ever was, and you NBC, are a very large part of the corruption as your ridiculous intro to this indicative of your trembling knee-shaking fear of what you know is in store yourselves and the filthy stinking corrupted party you support.
Clapping for himself Megan Kelly? His was applauding the brave Americans and his team.
#ThisIsWhyWeKneel
Bro I gotta watch this for a project
NBC is a real piece of work with their txt crawls
Great state of the union speech.
Weird democrat response, creepy.

I'm so sick of the democratic party disrespect of we the people.

Ironic this news dude says daca is overwhelmingly supported by most citizens, democrats and republicans. Forgetting centrists, libertarians, greens, account for a large chunk of voters.

Where are all these non liberals who support daca? Around the country, I find a 2/3 of citizens not in support of blanket daca.
Wow that was amazing
Fake speech!   Fake speech!  Fake speech!  Fake speech,  did i mention fake speech?
Wish he was my president. Greetings from New Zealand

#MAGA!!!
NBC is fake news. NBC'S coverage is strongly biased. They try so hard to put off everything Trump says as "stupid", by rolling their eyes and the heavy use of sarcasm. This is propaganda! Trump is a great president, and he has done nothing wrong at all to prove otherwise. It is true that he uses Twitter heavily, but is it so bad that he shares his thoughts with the world? The Russia investigations are nearly a means to somehow, some way get the president impeached. There is absolutely no evidence to prove President Trump colluded with Russia in any form. NBC is simply just a liberal news channel, and they want for Hillary because she is an insider with connections in the deep state. Some may point to her experience in politics as a reason why she should have been president, but what good is experience if that experience was shrouded in corruption? Her emails? The many deaths connected with her campaign, that were ruled as "suicide?". Trump for president 2020. Don't let corruption into our country!
How many times do they really have to stand up?? Seriously

Amazing speech I’ve never been so inspired and glad to be living in this great nation🇺🇸
TRUMP HAD BENZOS!!!!!!!
The spin is so off....lol.  They're so out of touch with reality.
I love this guy so much.
A brilliant speech by a brilliant president! As an American living abroad I am proud to be an American again.   Why do the democrats look so sour? Do they believe their own lies? Why does Nancy Pelosi look like a stick in the mud?
Typical that all they could talk about before the speech was the Russian investigation....get a life NBC
Trump is a fool!!

Jesus saves ❤️
Love this man! #MAGA
The guy who does the democratic response literally says nothing. Such a irrelevant speech
We once again have a President who loves this country!
😂😂Trump your the best !👍👍👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 You finally got rid of the horrible Obamacare penalty . It's not fair to penalize Americans who are barely making ends meet. Americans already pay enough taxes on food , clothes , cell phones , property taxes , car taxes . And many many more. And now they want mess with our tax refund for not having insurance
lmao at all the dems not clapping
Wow
God bless you President Trump! The best President we have had since Andrew Jackson.
Nobody going to talk about the fact, he just said he wants more nukes?
Someone start a gofundme to upgrade this man from the crutches they gave slave back in the day 2:47:42
I wonder how much they paid Russian bots to "thumbs down" this video? Still can't overcome the overwhelming support for our POTUS Donald J. Trump! God Bless him and God bless America!
This post is for all those people who have to write a paper about this address for class lol good luck y’all
Dems are MS13 supporters
GR*8 speech!
Why when you search Youtube for "State of the Union"  this video says streamed 3 weeks ago?  Are they trying to conceal it?
We could only wish to have such a great leader. In Sweden we have the opposite. A corrupt commie that brings in immigrants to cause civil war. Yey.
So funny, all the liberal DNC members sulking in their chairs like a bunch of spoiled crybabies who still can't accept that the world doesn't revolve around them. Trump, for a whole year, you've brought joy to my life, making progressives cry enough tears to end droughts in Africa =) Keep making America great.
Should've brought more water with me. My throat was very dry. Sad!
Be proud of your country, sure. Boosting nationalism tho can be a dangerous thing, learn from history, learn from what happened in Europe 70 years ago. The darkest time of mankind.
A lot of you anti trump idiots are just misinformed. If you still believe the Russian "collusion" after a year and a half, seek mental help. The same mental help u claim trump needs. Quit being a shallow believer and learn. Actually learn. I didn't become informed by sitting around complaining about leadership. It's just funny how those against conspiracy theories back in 16 have formed their own conspiracy. What a joke.
ANYBODY HERE FROM MR.PETERSON'S CLASS 2018??
NBCs Olympics failure again. They still talk while president starts to address, busy in manipulating viewers mind with all the talks making american people look stupid again while trump wants to make great again.
MAGA #notabot
robots
NBC tried so hard in the introduction to get people to have a bad vibe on Trump and failed. NBC you're a failure and you continue to hire the same failed panelists. It's laughable
WE LOVE YOU TRUMP
Claps for himself ... just like Communist dictators do... freaking dotard
man does Nancy Pelosi look triggered AF
Can Nancy Pelosi lighten up lmao
Tonight just showed Americans how little the democrats really care about Americans! They couldnt even clap over things that were for the betterment of the American people. Nancy Pelosi was playing with her dentures when the murder is announced  of 2 young girls by MS13 that is totally the Democrats fault. Votes are more important than American peoples children. Sickening, really.I  proudly stand, cheer, and applaud the POTUS on the SOTU  tonight. It’s a sad day for those who can’t cheer success and growth for the citizens they represent because they can’t see past party and politics.
STARTS @14:59
NBC sucks
2:35:50 jump here to actually see the president's speech.
What a horrible speech filled with nothing but lies lol
Absolutely blown away by how many people on the floor were GLUED to their phones.
POS!!!
Ugly old white men!!!
Lol how awkward when that fool walked in asking everyone if they were Republican lmao
For the first time in my life I will be buying investments under the Trump administration I am confident in Trumps economy. Trump is one of the greatest presidents of all time.
Great speech. Mr President
1:24:04 NBC trotted out their whole Trump bashing team,  right up to the last second they kept talking crap. At 1:32:07 ,  they shut up.  Just listen to those 8 minutes.  Please 8 minutes will tell you all you need to know about these "journalists" !  GIVE THIS A THUMBS DOWN  !  I know it's 4 hour video, please watch the 8 min intro at 1:24:04
Look at all the thumbs down. Might be a sign of things to come for NBC
Democrats are pathetic. Bottom feeding 5 year old babies
Katy, Donald Trump was handed a fight long before he was inaugurated (even by republicans). No one ever asked middle America what THEY wanted before. No president cared. Well America cared. America doesn't want another 'normal' president. Do you believe Donald created the controversy about his potential dentures, how about the book, maybe you think the Stormy Daniels rumors were his doing? Please don't lecture about media chatter... I like knowing what's on the presidents mind daily, I don't need to wait for an annual speech.  I think frequent communication is great. Is it a divisive moment every time you don't agree with him?
Bigotcheetoh for prison 2018! Impeach the orange!
Finally, a President of & for the people!!!
And what's with Pelosi?  She looks like an atomic lemon is stuck in her mouth.
he has endured "storms" - or "stormy" weather lol
what about all the people who died helping people in houston during hurricane harvey?  why remember them if they are not alive to act as a politcal pawn during the state of the union
:) Trump
Great speech from Trump and kennedy.
*clears throat* 

*leans into mic*

Chuck Schumer had a look on his face like his dog just died.  Way to go Trump!
*sniff* *sniff*....*snifff*

the actual part where trump starts talking is 2:40:10
*Wow..*
speech was absolutely incredible.  the commentators are fuckwads... cya losers
Excellent speech by our President.
GOD BLESS .The God Emperor.
1- even Paul Ryan wanted to prevent Trump's appearance (1:32:10)

Darrin T G.O.P = Grand Old Party.  Putin was born in the sixties.
Zack Klein how many indictments? I’ll answer for you 17, is the investigation complete, again I’ll answer for you, NO! Who appointed mueller? The republicans, who keep screeching the investigation is a witch hunt? I’ll answer, Don the orange con. His days are numbered, wake up comrade.
Darrin T It's not valid because the people who voted on both sides already new who they wanted regardless of of the leaked emails.
Zack Klein it’s not a dream, are you in reality; the GOP (gang of Putin’s) at the WH is desperate and the investigation is valid an ongoing. Ha ha.
Darrin T dream on.

Did you even listen to the speech? Black unemployment is at an all time low, as well as Hispanic unemployment. Also married couples will have their taxes cut in half. So for America, he’s done quite a lot. People have jobs and aren’t getting taxed through the roof like before.
Thank you Jimmy!
Megan Williams none of your business, and why do you want to know.
None of your business of how I make. But to be able to get insulin during the obama years I had to participate in diabetic drug trials. Worst years of my life.  No one should have to go that low in order to get medical supplies unless they want to.  I did not want to at all.  Almost lost our house too because couldn't afford both.
How much money do you make again?

C gatz I like how every time someone says something even a little bit negative about Trump, they’re marketed at a “snowflake”.
settle down snowflake, you'll  be ok
Donald Trump had nothing to do with that deficit or resulting mountain of debt, he can only move on and try to correct it. Now if we can only get him to keep his campaign promise to audit the fed. To stop printing money, backed by nothing but thin air, would be a good start (another thing that Donald Trump had nothing to do with).
My vocational training served me far better than my college degree. Both were helpful in my business but I paid for my college with my vocational training. For me there's nothing more rewarding than training others in my assorted vocations. For me the opportunity to abuse and humiliate others while training them is very rewarding.

Non Ya.  Wrong.  In 2017 the US was ranked 14th in happiness, down from 13th in 2016
That's what I just said... Thank god it's not popularity, that's why he will win again. Silent Majority rules. It's funny how we all knew he would win but none of the clueless libs did. It will happen again I promise.
Funny that Trump may be unpopular, but the US happiness level was ranked as 13th in the world in 2016 and in 2017 it moved to the 11th happiest country in the world. Looks as though the one that dislikes Trump are too stupid to know why they are happy.
You do know that he *lost* the popular vote right?  More people voted against him than for him and since the election his popularity has continued to fall.  Right now it's at the lowest in US history,. Only 1/3 of the country approves of him.  Not looking good
The presidency is not a popularity contest. Didn't we just prove that to you and every other person? More Americans want him than don't. If that wasn't true, he wouldn't be president. That should have been a wake-up call during the election.
Probably not the guy who is the least popular president in history
Michael Peterson such as.
No, it's really not. History is written by the victor, Donald Trump is rewriting history. Let history record that only days after Trump's historic speech, a certain memo struck the final blow to the Democratic Party. It may take them awhile longer to bleed out but they are done. (here's where you tell me about the Russian collusion again and assure me that Trump's downfall is eminent)
Phillip Craig.  Trump has done almost none of that
All4Him I second this.
Drunken Mongoose, I got money on Pelosis face
The obama depression was worse than the great depression. You are probably typing from mexico because trump had you deported.
That's kind of a vague statement. You're talking about Trump or Nancy Pelosi's face?
Jswines123 tell me more...
I believe it. Bumped it up to 1.5 and was still not difficult to follow.
The slowest speaking sotu address in at least 50 years, in fact.
I hope they were all wearing Depends™ because it looked like his edifying speech gave them all bowel movements.
Boondock i always hear that but never see proof.

Senpai Agustin tell your “teacher” that trump is doing a great job

I listen to people's personal experience not just a one sided "fact check site"
I will let you know if I get a change in my pay check this Febuary. that will be proof for me.
many fact checking sites have proven much of this speech to be lies or incorrect statements. they justifiably don't see a reason to clap for lies
Let's hope you're correct.
@Kenneth Sturmer place HRC in your comment, and youll be right, then!!  SORE LOSER! is all you are, well...and a moron!!  MAGA/2020!!!
They scream for socialism and want to burn the First and Second Amendment. That's why they will and arefailing.
If I wasn't  for gerrymandering  done by a Republican controlled house , Trump would not have won with the election. Clinton had more votes. So Trump supporter in fact don't  support democracy and support a president  who has been compared to a dictator.
You can have him . Americans don't want to  evolve . They're  stuck in the past and moving backwards. They'll  soon be Russia's  main allie.
Wayne Wayne    Republicans will rule the wH,unless the democraps cheat again like in 2018.
Spencer Dobkin   Most of didn’t stand much less clap,stupid commie motherf**kers!!! You will be remembered as a joke!
Trump will be in prison by the end of the year!
if you think this is bad, wait until he is re-elected in 2020! >:D

I can't wait to go salt mining XD
Still upset over losing the house eh?
Ryan Puttbrese I know you can never declared they'll never be another one of their president again as long as the party exists


And their big goal of the Democratic Party is to continue with Franklin D Roosevelt started
Ryan Puttbrese you can't be sure of that probably they will one of our future presidents might be keeping mine Republicans have been saying that for years


And then they get a new Democratic Party president


Same the other way around with Republicans

Maybe one day they'll be one of the Libertarian party or the Green party
Elias Figueroa but he hasn't quit on them
i agree, epecially since Trump has actually been getting a lot of things done right...the fact that so many jobs were created, employment rates for all ethnicities are at an alltime low, the economy has increased by almost 3%, working class has had the tax cuts they want and getting raises, criminals are being deported, and a lot of SJW and political correctness has been shut down or at the very least lost momentum gives many voting Americans trust in the Republican Party. They have seen that what Trump has done is working. Democrats have not been getting themselves together. Many are still playing a lot of games with identity politics, looking to their emotions as their stance on issues rather than logic/facts, and are overall being very uncoordinated as to how to run a successful campaign against a Republican Party that has proven them completely wrong on how they have been running a country and that has gotten more results than Obama and Bush have gotten.
Spencer Dobkin democrat Diane Feinstein behind certain boundaries that Democrats and Republicans alike agreed on


Like the safe sports act
Spencer Dobkin ye
no they're still focused on the current president... not unreasonable
Spencer Dobkin Who knows they might not all Democrats are being big breaths nowadays the majority of the American people stand against Trump or his radical right wing views 


He has not went on the Democratic party he seeks to work with them in the Republicans alike


The majority of Democrats are not these bratty times that you think of many are still loyal to these old fashion wings Democrats are the disciples of Franklin D Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson


However on this matter they had been at this for years before Donald J Trump thinking that it's in moral to have a system of the electoral college that goes not by the candidate who gets the most of the popular vote and think we should get rid of that and only depend on the popular vote that's what leads to this

Yes, for a third world country
He's not blocking immigrants, just illegal immigrants. And how does that make his statement untrue?
Big Pun this country is evil.
How much money do you make again?
Cuz im a modern day slave at 9 an hour :)
Megan Williams is it because of politicians that you’re making 7 bucks an hour? I don’t think so. What’s the minimum wage in your state anyway?
Working for 7.25, can't afford college! Modern day slavery.
Greedy politicians. Can't buy a house cuz the market was ruined. 
Oh BOY!!! I love the Devil..... I mean America.

This is some crazy backwards thinking. Exact opposite of reality.
Commie chick.  Pinko.  AMY ELLIOTT IS A COMMUNIST
@LucisFerre1 The facts are rightists are all brainwashed to support a party which puts money and party before country.
Rush Limbaugh once said to a teenage caller "the adults in the room have left"  when explaining what has happened to the democratic party in the last 30 years.  Rush said that the mainstream Democrats worked with Reagan and Bush 41 , and compromised to keep the country running well.  They were patriots and put country above ideology for the sake of their constituents. Those members kept the radical members in check.  Now that the restraining hand of the "adults" in the room has left, all we have left are the crazies
They seem constricted, looks to me like they just need a healthy dose of Metamucil™.
The facts are in. Leftists hate American prosperity and individual independence.
You just gave us a clue that you're an imbecile.
OK,  Fidel.
doreen edwards you are a pathetic and ignorant racist.  Shame on you
Youre so cognitively biased and diluted, youre beyond help. You made this wild theory up and now everything that happens is seen through race tinted goggles. Pathetic and sad.
You obviously don't know what a white supremacist is.
It had nothing to do with Obama's color. It had to do with his extreme hatred for America and the policies and regulations he enacted that hurt the American people more than anything. You might be a racist, or claim other people are, but if you don't specifically know a person that made racist comments then you can't claim that someone else is. WE had to live through 8 years of bad democrat policies and programs and we were fed up. And now, as a result of Trump removing thousands of Obama regulations and reducing taxes, jobs are being created and people have more of their own money that they earned.
I guess I can empathize, Hillary got the popular vote, she should have been prom queen but still, some respect of protocol would have been nice.
I'd rather be honorable. If one person has a sword, then all the others must have swords, too. We have a habit of destroying countries who don't have nukes, such as all of the countries in the Middle East that we've annihilated. You know why we aren't touching Iran? Nukes. Those people are able to live in their own homeland because they are protected. If Iran had no nukes, the Iranian people would have lost their home long ago to us.
It's OK with me. You would rather that the whole world has nukes?
He is a Great President
If he's not the last.  If the Left wing radicals have their way, we're going for Civil War 2.  And an ugly one at that.  Buckle up,. the powder keg has a shortening fuse.  I hope he can do like Abraham Lincoln did when it blows.  This next election in 2018 NOV. -- If the Democrats are sent packing at the ballet box, they may incite a 2nd civil war.  Children throw tantrums when they don't get their way.  We must be ready to spank very very hard.

Pretty sure the unemployment rate was 0% before Lincoln
@Neil o'Donnell Yes another nitwit spouting unsubstantiated facts. No surprise he supports Trump.
they dont applaud because trump is taking credit for President Obama's work
ccoghill23 unemployment was highest under obama so it was easy to lower the unemployment rate and at that time people were getting jobs on their own so Obama had nothing to do with the unemployment rate
They don't want what's best for anyone. They want power, they need power, they crave power, they will say anything to get that power back.
ace love true
higherkite because he has nothing to do with it. 

The unemployment rate for African-Americans fell to 6.8% in December, the lowest level since at least 1972, when the Labor Department began tracking the figure. White unemployment was 3.7% in December, Asian-American unemployment was 2.5% and Hispanic joblessness was 4.9%.

They are still almost 3 times more unemployed that Asian Americans. If I took credit for Toyota’s great sales numbers yet only been ceo for a year and didn’t change anything in the company then how can I take credit for that? The low employment is still coming from Obama presidency. 

Only thing he has passed that made change was his tax plan. And the stock market isn’t looking to healthy. He made a bubble market even bigger.
Yes, I heard about that, but what does that have to do with the African American population getting a lower unemployment rate?
higherkite, read about Trump's history during the 80s and 90s. His business pushed out blacks from housing projects and onto the streets, among other things...
if people are self sufficient; they cant rob the tresury anymore.
higherkite they want to keep  blacks down so they can profit off the victim narrative.
the republicans did the same to obama.....

Nice! Glad to have ya!
AxelingHdh572 Fbxndhdhjsd he doesnt.
He does not hate their country, he hates the minority of illegal immigrants that come here, not to build a better life for themselves, but to cause chaos and take advantage of our system.  Notice I said the minority of illegal immigrants, the majority of illegals simply want to work and make a better life than they had in their country of origin.
cannot tell if b8 or just a misinformed person.

Not just clean coal BEAUTIFUL clean coal
That's fine!! Just have the balls to admit that you are against all forms of immigration. You fooled millions of people making them believe that you were just against illegals.

When he stops insulting people and belittling everyone that’s not him, I’ll hate him a little less

True that It's just that I didn't like how he said my country was a sh*thole country
So far Trump is doing a good job!! People need to quit being so sensitive!
You would do well to go back and listen to speeches from former presidents, for basis of comparison.
Smokedship american are dreamer too is far and away the best line in that speech The American Dream brings people from near and far. To partake of the American experience American Dreamers living the American Dream is why America is an exceptional country MAGA America First

They're all at that age where the enlarged prostrate would be putting pressure on there bladder's.
SO you aren't going to cite your sources for your claim that he's putting out false information?
Well, I'm willing to listen. What information did he put out that was false?
Robert DuBois I was not talking about CNN. They are extremely biased. But it is just way too easy just too google something and it appears that Trump does give false information. Also the sources he gives for his information are biased and has been proven many times. I just don't really trust someone that is in charge of about 1/3 of the country that can't even fact check himself.
What false information? CNN's fact check has already been debunked.
I wish he would run again he seems like a great guy.
Again. God's mad at us. Which is why were gonna get set on fire.
God bless America!
God's mad at America.
YES
We don't need to watch Fox to know what's going on, but at least we don't believe the lying fake news that all you liberals soak up.
No, like a team working together to get the right things done for the American people.
exactly...like lemmings following each other over a cliff.....
SO what if you don't watch Fox. I watch Fox, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, and CBS. And then I look at the actual results of what's going on. Numbers only tell part of the story. Results that are measurable and quantifiable are what are important.
Wow, you should go to your doctor and have them adjust your medications. You're truly living in an alternate reality inside of your head. Go get help. You certainly need it.
Mario B you are incorrect. Good try though.
You first.

He in truth is very close to getting the wall he wants. This is due to the fact that Democrats will soon be forced to fund the wall in order to get DACA if they want to keep DACA at all.
What has he actually accomplished? Please explain that to me. When was the last update on that stupid wall? He has achieved absolutely nothing.
Scholar thats true but it doesnt contradict what ive said. Even with such a huge drop, the dow is still higher than its been under any president.

Edit: Heres what im talking about
http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart
You can see the big drop youre talking about right at the end of the chart. However, when looking at it in the context of the dow's history, the market is doing remarkably well. And it will go up again soon. Thats just the nature of the stock market.
Penelope Seale this is the lowest it’s dropped since 2008. Maybe you should more research
Scholar the dow is still higher than its been under any other president. Maybe you should do a little more research before talking about things you know nothing about.
It goes up and down, its normal. Overall it has done a lot better.
Yea, why is Dow so low right now? Instead of exposing negativity like he’s the drama column on the newspaper he should be making America better, like he claims he’s doing
The man, the myth, THE DOG! yeah, he is amazing
Like a catholic mass huh? Lol
Major maybe if your an obese grandmother.  Ever been to church?
kimberly Rousseau that's because you're not poor.
I haven't you heard they made straws illegal.
So it was over your head, huh?
They have to call them racist, it's all they've got.
Drunken Mongoose Well u sure know about that.  I never said Nazis but u sure did.  So your not playing dumb after all.  Lol... dumb punk!
That's what I thought. No proof. You have a Nazi fetish so you play pretend.
Drunken Mongoose Stupid u are then punk.  Shut up stupid playing dumb punk!
You must be. Put up or shut up.
Drunken Mongoose  Now we are playing stupid huh.  Lol...
Which mass shootings. Proof?
Drunken Mongoose They exist starting with the mass shootings and your playing dumb tactic.
Just stop pretending they exist and everything will be OK.
Andy Tomlins 
Yea sure it was libtard
So do you expect stocks to just go up straight and never go down? Yes I look at the stock market now and it just went back up again for 5 days straight. Stocks will always move up as well as down but it move up more than down.
Aaron Thorhammer look at the stock market now...
Nathan McGowan yea keep dreaming loser. Under that Muslim traitor obumma the welfare state in America rose to its highest level EVER in this country. Obumma was a POS like you......and that's WHY Americans voted demoncrats out all over this country so FY
Because they care about money more
Look at the stock market since Trump took office, and look at data of countries bringing jobs back since he was elected.  It's been historic.  So year, it's all because of Obama.  You're a hater.  No matter what he would do, he wouldn't please you, because Trump is evil.
Because most of the credit should go to Obama...
Jimmy TwoShoes your absolutely right.
Nah man; I'm from Texas
SnowFaust_MTS I think you talking about, “new world order”. Or one world government.
We are russian bots now lol...been called worse by worse lol
SnowFaust_MTS so we shouldn't help the people we have here that need are help? we should let more in without fight to be here the correct way, by becoming citizens within are guide lines but by becoming a weed that lives a halfway life of food cards and under paid job's? That's how we help by saying you can live here but not as one of us? I don't know where you when to school but you might want to look up what you think Obama did for this nation. you can walk down the street and see the good trump is doing day by day, where it was pushed down are throats what obama was doing from people who didn't care about us. yes we should help people out but not when we are dying in the progress.
SnowFaust_MTS You have it all wrong sir.
Pro-American is evil, another way to say you don't care about your fellow human beings by spreading the mindset of nationalism, we should be working to get to a point where we can identify as residents of planet earth, not some country and its flag.
Phillip Craig, that's literally everything the previous POTUS did, though. Cognitive dissonance, fascinating.
Lowest unemployment, keeping illegals out, honors veterans and other heroes, increased wages for all, decrease taxes, create jobs, crack down on gang violence, helping poor people to get on their feet and contribute to society, driving down prices of medications, who wouldn’t want cheaper meds?? And on and on
Dang, I did not vote Trump, but will next e
We are real people, in the US (Texas for me) and we love our President and our country. We’ll vote for him again, and support pro-American politics!
M K. No we are all real... we are all educated, and I hope you know that I, a minority, love Trump for what he does.
Hike Masters Source?
remembered forever for degrading the office of the president with his serial lying, racism, misogyny & bigotry.....where have you been the last 12 months, under a rock???
President Trump is a Great President , the sourpuss democrats need to grow up!
Yeah, he is.
SnowFaust_MTS I’m sorry I don’t understand the things you are posting on my feed. But if that’s what he really said he must be doing a really good job if he won the presidency despite every influential person in Hollywood bashing him.
Martincito hello it’s write* this is why you cannot be involved in decisions for our country when you cannot even speak the English language. He did not once look down at the “paper” he was reading and it’s pretty hard to memorize an hour long speech that you didn’t write yourself... or feel passionate about like he did. Trump is doing an amazing job. Please watch the video and you will see that.
They are being sold feelings by trump, he said himself his one best strategy is to sell feelings. people buy in to all that naturally i guess
I wonder how can people be so stupid??? The guy is reading a speech which he couldn't and didn't right. and we know he means nothing of what he's saying. UNITED STATES IS GREAT ALREADY AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN
To ny you acting like people are going to care about you.
Alexandria Stalter you’re subscribed to people like manny mua and Shane Dawson but forget that trump doesn’t associate himself with anyone from the lgbt community, nor do most of his supporters
It's been an honor interacting with you, fellow piece of the universe, it warms my heart.

Doc Iris Ramirez DVM Thank you for seeing the media for what it is & recognizing what Trump is. 

It is an absolute miracle he got elected with all of the propaganda from the media to the masses. God Bless.
#FACTS - We just shouted you out on our daily show... check the channel it just went up...
HA HA, teambox,  for him that is an accomplishment.  He did act the part a year ago to me anyway..
Doc Iris Ramirez DVM welcome to the RIGHT SIDE brother. You give me hope yet for our younger generations.
dont you find it strange.. how calling the president presidential, is some sort of accomplishment these days?
Doc Iris Ramirez DVM He did away the Obama Care mandate wasn't that great for service provider like you and people looking for services like me
nice
Well said
I figured I'd see u here. His clapping remind me of stalin

it's only classified to protect the FBI who obstructed justice. They have broken our laws and once the memo is released the people will see the injustice they committed.
osamabindrinkin40s he’s missing one thing. He needs to drop the ego and stop belittling people. Just a thought
The speech he gave in Warsaw was very good too, you should check it out if you missed it.
SlimNubster.  Probably because he didn't wrote it
Why?? You're going to get more of tax returns in 2019 because of Trump!!  Plus unemployment rate is down for African American's and small businesses are doing great!
It's something he's been saying at his rallies lots of times :)
It's something he's been saying at his rallies lots of times :)

Nah dude
Seize the means of Production - First off, great user name, secondly, you are correct.

This chart isn't from FOX or MSNBC, but directly from the Department of Labor Statistics. No media spin here. Just those pesky facts that were demanded.
https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000
If you look at an employment rate chart it is extremely clear that the declining unemployment rate is a trend from the Obama era.
YOU ARE A FUDGE...
Like Obama's added jobs which were part time and/or seasonal ones? Trump's stats are much more accurate than that fool's. MAGA
Delovely 1 >jumping to assumptions with zero facts,  Oh boy the irony
Delovely 1 it’s easier for us poc to see through the bs
Delovely 1 dude wtf the economy was crashing a few points in time during the osama presidency!!  & THATS FACTS!
Yeah, The Obama deserves credit right? THEN WHY DIDN'T ECONOMIC SUCCESS HAPPEN A FEW DAYS BEFORE TRUMP TOOK OVER... OR A YEAR BEFORE... OR TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE???

You are the one that's delusional. The Obama was handed an economy in virtual tatters, had 8 freaking years to correct it, and had nothing but floundering, sputtering, lame performance. "The New Normal" remember?

Donald Trump comes in, reverses course, does the OPPOSITE of you Dems, and the economy takes off,  and you freaking Dems are gonna take credit for Trump's success??? 

Trump is doing the OPPOSITE of what you clowns were doing. You had failure, he's getting successful results. 

Nuff said.
I mean...did you?
i bet you watch stephen colbert
Just google it.   https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/07/29/seven-years-later-recovery-remains-the-weakest-of-the-post-world-war-ii-era/
I do not know what stats you are looking at because that is not true at all, wow.  Even your media says the last 8 years was the slowest recovery in our history and that is a big deal, surprised they said it out loud, but I heard it with my own ears recently.
Maybe a dash too far there champion. Still just a man, though I do adore him
Jim Meh That's because he wants to put people to work.
His approval rating is at 32%.
just all the lemmings following each other over the cliff......
Dime10 1 he actually is responsible for black employment being the Lowest due to high optimism he created for the economy. More people are being hired in general which means blacks and all other Americans unemployment has gone down. What the statement says for me is that America isn’t as racist as leftist say it is. If it really were you would think black people wouldn’t be affected positively by the atmosphere trump brought which the assumption was people would be more outgoing with their racism. But it turns out people are driven more by money then race. Racism is still alive but not nearly as prevalent and as much of a issue that it’s made to be
@Dime101  "received less that half of the popular vote" The popular vote isn't even a full representation of the political stance of the American population because a lot of the population doesn't vote. 

It's the closest thing we have to a full representation but it's also completely irrelevant as an indicator of who is/isn't going to be in this YouTube comments section because, plainly, we don't have everyone that voted in this comments section so there's absolutely no reason to expect similar percentages. 

(On a side note: It did surprise me too when I first started reading the comments that most of them were positive, because internet, but that doesn't indicate conspiracy in any way.) .
Dime10 1 it's because the majority of people on YouTube are young people
ikr (pls no hate im only here for an article review project)
look at all these anti trump bots, god they are everywhere like cockroaches, YouTube is spending it's money on a bunch of America hating bots, how shameless, all these fake hateful personas are poor quality AI if you ask me
Or is it the polls are flawed in how they collect info? That's more than likely it. And the bots are those down voting the video. Dims never can fool everybody, only the weak minded.
Bat Batterson well considering trump received less that half of the popular vote and him being highly disliked compared to any other preseident, it’s weird to see almost every comment saying stuff like “God bless President Trump” or “Trump is the greatest president of all time” and stuff like that
Cupcake Cookie when he said unemployment for African Americans was the lowest its ever been. That statement could lead some to believe he is responsible however Black unemployment has been on a downward trend for several years, and his policies didn’t just magically make that happen. This happened several times in his speech where he would say something good has happened when he was president, but he really wasn’t responsible for some of these things
Yea sp true CNN says his approval rating is 10% like they said Hillary would win by a landslide nationwide.  Blah blah blah you are such a sheep and you actually believe the "bots" b.s meanwhile Twitter admit that wasn't actually the case the "bots" accounted for 0.01% of the tweets lol.  You are constantly lied to and this is called bias politics and corrupt people covering corrupt people with "propoganda".  My advice is to try and see through the filth.  Its obvious left wing news has an agenda and twitter and also YouTube are notoriously leftist so when they bash trump you don't question for one second maybe just maybe its biased to sway you to vote against him?  That way they get their politicians back in?  Its called politics dude.
@Dime101 Approval ratings are polls of a limited number of individuals that are then extrapolated to give a guess at the approval rating of the entire population. They're not an actual representation of the thoughts of the entire population. (Gathering that data would be a massive undertaking) 

Also, approval ratings do not tell you the percentages in the political beliefs of the specific YouTubers who are commenting/liking comments in this particular section. 

A lot of the people who hate Trump who visit the video may just be coming to the video solely to click the dislike button. Maybe there's a lot of bots that come to this video just to dislike. There's no way for us to really tell. It's pure speculation.
Or, you know, maybe a lot of the things he said were amazing. Can you please give me a few examples of the things you didn’t like about his speech? (You know, other than saving a baby. And insurance for veterans. And that part about terrorists. Unless you didn’t like those things.)

ur mom is the bomb    As a plausible moderation , the process is stable. Trump maintains a structure that is significant within the bounds of consideration. However, the precursor to any event is a well formulated adherence to structure, foundation, and consideration. I guarantee that most of these next seven years will have a historical venue that predates any juxtaposition, weather we emerge in a timely fashion or not.

A Man Apart you are delusional
If you like Obama's presidency and his policies, you should move to Cuba because they have similar policies.
ISE Gaming Obama has undeniably raised taxes. That’s how he got Obama care paid for.

The patriot act that HE SIGNED legalized spying on American citizens.

There’s no evidence to support that. Trump is 100% innocent.
@Zoe Funny how Obama has never done either of the things you've said he has and technically, Trump is supporting a World Power of Russia, in which THEY are responsible for hacking the elections. Plus, Trump is already being suspected of treason. And his cutting taxes only come for the rich and top 1%, not for middle class families that need it more.
You do realize that raising taxes helps support the government right? Just because you can't pay em doesn't mean you have to hate on em. And I actually liked obama.
A Man Apart against the constitution bud.
A Man Apart PFFFFF. What, spying on it’s own citizens and raising taxes?
I Couldn't Think Of An Original Name... you are a pathetic American
Lmao I love how delusional you are
Are you stupid? Obama hasn’t been in office for a whole year. And when he was in office the economy was nothing like it is now. You are ignorant and a wishful thinker.

ha ha ha....he won't even be on the ballot
ozkan cil He's very real
Shocking to see such ignorant comment because apparently you have bought into the lies of CNN because this is the most popular president ever in American history and he is for the American people not of the Communist socialist corrupt government as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in the Democratic party which has just now passed a New York City law murdering full-term babies in the womb but people like you vote for them but just as surely as God says innocent blood will be on your hands as well.
"There cannot be peace with investigations" -ur potus, so I'm afraid ppl have to let him go, unless you directly want to oppose your state od the head/commit treason.

@Jonathan Bronson  In reality you are ignorant and need Jesus in your heart so that he may God you and show you the truth of what a good man President Trump is and by the way since you think he is so bad you are probably one of those food stamp recipients that he made sure was paid 2 months in advance due to the shutdown.. stop being brainwashed by the liberal media that controls the TV.

trugangsta4real Guys I found one!
Hey There your exactly right
its shocking bc the media is mostly controlled by one party so it creates an illusion of honest opinion, its a fabricate narrative, tv hosts, most media and actors and entertainment are all the same party not bc of virtues, its just of the same reasons people will always root for the same team even if the team sucks, it shouldn't be about party, trump isn't even a real republican but he ran as one. If people just watch and see, they'll realize all the hate comes from hateful media that has its hands in every facet of technology, it all comes from the same owners. The idea that so many hate him comes from a few people with lots of resources and its so sad how they use brainwashing techniques to turn so many hateful. I have been democratic most of my life and hated bush but the parties switched roles recently, this guy is doing some real stuff for the country and you see here people of all races and colors support him, the opposition comes from the global mafia he attacked when he ran. They own most of the media, this guy is not really what they say he is, not even Bush Jr got It this bad and that guy is responsible for countless deaths, trump really hasn't done anything horrible at all but they act like everything he does is disgusting.

Donald Trump trump is so far from "a great leader" and "the media" has nothing to do with people thinking that. Trump is a nut job and people who voted for him should be embarrassed.
what a fool!
April J Trump is a great leader but sadly the media here in the US has brainwashed too many people into thinking “our democracy is at stake”. 
We aren’t even a democracy. Read some quotes from the founding fathers, they hated democracy. Our country is actually a Republic and people want to change it. It stems from a fundamental ignorance of what the USA is all about and frankly it is sad they don’t require kids to know this stuff to pass history class. We barely learned history while younger. My parents learned a lot more in class. A lot more. Our teachers are failing us as students. Don’t get me wrong at least half of them are great but almost half of them are terrible too. Trump will run on that for his second term and focus on school choice so it helps the black kids in the inner cities who don’t deserve to receive such a third world education. Trump will fix that!
exactly!!!
Hillary for prison
Who cares?? He's doing a good job so far! Better than Obama!  Set you pride and quit being so sensitive! I'm Asian too and I can't care less what he has to say about different race!
Hike Masters how is he a racist when all he does is help people of color live better lives , he’s more focused than Obama was the entire 8 years . You can tell he’s more real and honest than past few presidents at least
If he's a racist, why is the Black unemployment rate so low?
They  don't want  to  hear  the  bull sh*t
the man is a racist, so why would any African-American stand up for him??? Where have you been the last 12 months???  Just another lemming following all the rest over the cliff....

I love Satomi❤️
Want get to married❤️
I agree! But smell isn't everything.
Joseph Martin Then I can say the quality of life in Japan and South Korea are better than us, does it make them better than America and China? No. You can't simply say that America is better because of the quality and you can't say other countries are worse due to stereotypes, stop over glorifying America as something great.
Kenn 2222 I've been around the United States and to different places in the world, and I can honestly say the quality of life here is 10x better than what it is in China.  I can't respect your opinion, because it's the adoption of weakness.
Joseph Martin BTW, I never included you guys in my "weak minded comment" it was simply my opinion. America was never great if you look back at our past, I believe its best for you to avoid saying that America is great because your living there, if you just believe in one thing without having an open mind, your just self conscious.
Joseph Martin In that case, what is a President? Its the face of the people. Our president reflects our nation along with the people, looking at our President I really have serious doubts about our people as well. Are we actually united? How do you compare China peoples with ours? If you ever visited China, each of them have a strong sense of Nationalism but as in America, half of us still question Trump as a President.
Kenn 2222 A government does not reflect a nation. It might lead the nation to failure, or to prosperity,  but a nation consists of the prowess of its people. China is strong in its government,  not it's people
Kenn 2222 
Please do not include the rest of us in your weak minded comments. We ARE strong.  Just because you are weak does not mean that the rest of us sit in retention.
America isn't strong at all. China is going to become the number 1 country soon, move to china children.
Arnold Kevorkov If you are referring to the Russian, I would agree that you are the drunkest, I would agree that you are the best at gambling natural resources for food. I would agree that your leaders have never looked out for you
Joseph Martin we are the strongest

You are proof abortions are sometimes a better choice.
U can tell this is ur first state of the union address. Its tradition for the opposite party not to stand for many of the applause. The only thing both parties stand for is valance issues like veteran health care and stuff like that.
That did not bother me and I'm an African, my people don't find that racist. Also I'm democrat how can I be racist to my own country

I loved the close up on the "black demoract group" when Trump said african american unemployment was at an all time low.  They seemed to hate the idea?? Bizarre
Shirley like petty little children on timeout
Why would god bless a country instead of the people living in it, and why would god only bless a specific group of people at a time.
he has a speech writer, none of it was written by him. same for other presidents. the only time he's using his own words is when he ad libs like he frequently does at rallies. so if you think he did a good job reading it, then you should applaud him for reading so slowly.
Art Dalton agreed my dude
Qrow Branwen Thanks for having an open mind, not disliking because you just think you're supposed to. Republican, Democrat, whatever, we should ALL be for the betterment of the American people.

Pamela Murillo go tell him to fix DOW, then we can talk
Trump just trolled the Democrat haters and won spectacularly. They showed that they are more concerned with illegal aliens than Americans. They showed that success for blacks and hispanics is less important than partisan politics. They proved to all of America that they are truly anti-American.
Charles Hess I do, do you see how bad it is? We can’t have anymore government shutdown by these Clown Republicans and Clown Democrats. They are just using our tax money.
Sooooo.. I'm guessing you don't comprehend the Electoral College?
Charles Hess Although Trump has SOME good policies (not MANY) The entire nation is responsible for problems at Home. Both Republicans and Democrats. We need a population vote system, that uses our social security. Let’s see if he administrates a much more helpful voting system, to include the American Citizens into exclusive and common voting decisions.
Yeah... Keep watching the "news"   HAHAHAHAHA   TRUMP 2020!!!
Charles Hess Not Really Charles, The president is in a Pot of Boiling Water with his Soviet Cousins. Have you not been hearing the news. This speech was the best thing sense and they’ll clap every time he made a statement.

LamePseudonym1  I can list a million things DNC did wrong in the previous administration and even things they are doing wrong under Trump’s administration. Yet you’re going into partisan politics like a lot of people in this country do. “My party is always good and the other party is always bad” mentality has been destroying this country
DNC spam.

All right. I don't know why I'm black myself but I live in Germany and most people here don't like him because he is "racist" . I don't even know why I don't like him or why I get this bad feeling when I see him.
It's just weird. ~maybe media is the reason?~
Racist is a loaded term
I'm the least racist person on the planet and Trump got a higher percentage of Black, Hispanic and Asian votes than any Republican has in a very long time.
Reagan was the first POTUS to bring guests to the State of the Union Address.
Penelope M. No you don’t your not the president
Relax its pre written
You clearly never watch one
Since you haven't watched one before. Every president does this during the state of the union speech.

LamePseudonym1 You're obviously not on the level.  I'm reclaiming my time!  Get!
Reread my comment because you clearly didn't get it.
LamePseudonym1 Wrong!  Go look at black unemployment for the last 3 years under the Obama presidency.  What you'll see is a steady decline!  If you go out to last year, 2017, you'll see a consistent path!  You can graph it if you want.  I have.
Black unemployment under Obama never got as low as it was under Bush before the Fannie/Freddie bubble burst so............
Oh yes!!!!

ZARAirsoft shut up u idoit hes a RASIST
Richard Saeed better was not Clinton though and Bernie was ready to tax you close to 50%, and that’s why Trump is president. Also, to add to your discussion he is trying to get rid of the loophole that illegals can use to just run right back into the country after repeated crimes. This happens so often and people act like it’s nothing. Latest example was the guy who killed Edwin Jackson. So Obama sending 2 million illegals is interesting because he continued to promise illegals path to citizenship and was unable to deliver. Also even though he sent out the people, people crossing the Mexican border were the only ones able to easily return even after committing numerous crimes. People blame the other side for one side not delivering but you have to make good deals to be able to deliver and Trump knows how to put good offers on the table. He more than doubled Daca in return of something that the other side and I think most people want, a tougher border. That’s a smart deal because it can give everybody what they want, unless all the dems want to do is deny him out of spite and make him look bad. That’s why they are super sour right now, he’s challenging their word on their policy by handing it to them.
Sabastian Auth, under the previous administration over two million illegal immigrants were deported... the highest number under any administration thus far. It's important to be critical of all persons/brances of government- though we can support whom we want, it's imperative to remain critical of the flaws that remain within our current administration (and those previous). Time and again has it been proved that Trump isn't entirely truthful among other things, and for that we are critical. Americans deserve better than the current admin...
Sabastian Auth Did we go legally to war when W.  Sent us?
There is a stark contrast that exists between Obama's presidency and Donald Trump's presidency. Obama wanted to overreach the limits imposed upon the federal government, he wanted to turn America in to a welfare state, and he inadvertently reignited somewhat of a race war by talking about the colour of skin. He also was lenient on immigration which has been proven to cause economic disparity.

Donald Trump on the other hand believes in the states having more power than the federal government, meaning more liberty for everybody. He believes everybody has a chance to be successful and wants to help make that possible by correcting the damage that welfare programs have done to us. He wants to do things to ensure immigrants come over legally to stop the crime that comes along with having a gaping hole next to a criminal cesspool. Number one is liberty, and the idea that some people, who make decisions for you, don't agree with liberty should make you impassioned.
Brian Wood They stood when he talked about things that were objectively good.
I actually, I think instead of kicking Immigrants out we should make it easier for them to come in. One of them could cure cancer or do something wonderful for America. Why are we deporting them?
LaMigrasa Marxa They are the reason you have cheap food
Our taxes dont go to them haha. Our taxes really should be spent on things we need. We dont need a border wall for mexico. They dont even travel in the open nd I they do 90 percent of them get caught. They build tunnels I mean look at el chapo he got out of jail because of a tunnel they made
they cant even get legal jobs here anyway. They have to work under the radar doing tree work, landscaping, roofing, concrete..etc
Ghost Purp well I'd rather our taxes go to protecting our borders than financially supporting illegals immigrants.
Nathan McGowan well that statement aged well
I guess it doesn’t matter who are president is because they all have ties with people who are not American.
Yeah, just like that! Glad we agree.
Oh you mean like Clinton’s were with George Soros and the Saudis.
Because he's already on a Russian leash.
A true parrot .Saying what he was told to say, true or not !
You spelled PARROT wrong. I’ll use that in a sentence for you: “Putin’s PARROT is ruining America”.
ALVARO ARAUJO is a commie.  Call the FBI  And Immigration.  Commie.  Commie
A true patriot....... that doest even know the words to the national anthem.
What branch of the armed service did he put his life on the line for? What groups of Americans has he brought together? If that is what a true Patriot looks like, we need less of them. How's your 401k looking there buddy. I'm not a genius but I pulled a grand majority out of high risk and parked it in money market when this clown started his trade war. So predictable that he would tank growth with that maneuver. "He's stoping China from expanding it's influence" I hear you saying. No, he is handing the middle east to Iran though. Your boy is off the rails, or being a true Patriot by metrics I'll never understand.
Star Art - First, I'll start with your straw man, move on to your Trump-speak (cherry-picking and omission of portions of fact that would detract from the legitimacy of an agenda) and then address your random, bouncing-bullet comments.

Never, not once, did I say, or even imply, that since Hitler took power in Germany, then all Germans alive at the time were Nazis. I said that exactly zero times. That would be a blanket statement and I don't use blanket statements as One does not define the Collective. Such a blanket statement would fail entirely seeing as Hitler was Austrian, so I'm not really sure how you built your strawman to begin with. There were plenty of Germans that defected to avoid the Nazi party's growing power and violence. There were also plenty of Germans that stood their ground and met their demise in defiance of the Nazis. To associate your run-on examples of Koreans and bad dogs with something I never said to begin with is a textbook demonstration of the strawman and nothing more.

Moving on to the Trump-speak: How convenient that when you copied and pasted your Google search of the definition of patriot that you stopped before the line that expands to the synomimous. That said line says "synonyms:	nationalist, loyalist; More." That, I did speak of. (Look for yourself. I don't edit my posts.) Hitler was very much a nationalist, or as you would say, "patriot", and his modes of assimilation parallel much of what you see in the US today. Flag worshiping, excessive displays of national flags, imperialism by way of invading countries and committing genocide, intolerance to those that would have different options than that of the governing body, disarmament of the people, abolition of free speach, XENOPHOBIA, unwarranted government spying, creating divisiveness amongst the people by pointing out trivial differences and pushing a national religion. 

Random bouncing-bullets:

If you're asking what president wasn't patriotic, you're starkly contradicting other Republicans that would claim that Democrats hate America. Which is it?

Lastly, you can't copy and paste the definition of patriot and then turn around and say that definitions are subjective. I'm mean, you can if you want. I'm not calling you stupid, but it makes you appear to be stupid.

Next!
Hitler was a patriot. Patriots just enforce blind nationalism. I'm sure you're familiar with how well Hitler's patriotism worked out for Europe. 

I have bad news for you; patriotism is, in fact a bad thing. It embodies racism, intolerance, xenophobia, unchecked propaganda and a general hated of those whose views don't align completely with all of the said Patriot's views.
Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
Yeah patriots are stupids, you're right.
*nationalist
A true gangster
You misspelled ‘traitor’ there.
TRAITOR
Yes, a true patriot who sold the US out to Putin and has a wife from Slovenia and an ex-wife from Czechoslovakia. It doesn't get any more patriotic than that. I'm so glad I don't live in the US. 
Your country is now the biggest joke on earth, thanks to your leader who tweets like a 15 year old girl, and you followers, who speak of him as if he is Christ, descended from the heavens, to save all of you who are living paycheck to paycheck. Because that's what billionaires do, right?

Steph Cat what has he done to YOU specifically?
OperationIZ people like you have been diving america
Victory Sampson government shutdown was caused by democrats unwilling to work with president trump.
well said, jaden!
Steph Cat How?
trugangsta4real Read my above comments, my dude, and learn something.
OperationIZ He's trying to undivide America but he can only do so much. It's up to the individual to get their head out of their own... Media is also a widely known contributer to dividing the country, via biased and fake news (don't even argue with me cause I can prove everything).
Victory Sampson What has Trump done? He eradicated the NAFTA trade agreement (backed by Hillary Cliton). He exposed corruption in the FBI. He took the fight to Syria and knocked down our enemies door which the previous administration was scared to do. He doesn't show cowardness and litterally addresses people with courage and is not afraid to flex America's power (much like how Putin is with Russia... He'd straight up tell everyone his button is bigger than everyone else's). Regardless of how you like my previous sentence, you must admit, a President with no filter is a first, and that doesn't hide anything.  2.4 million new jobs in America via 2017. Unemployment rate for African Americans is lowest in history. Stock market has increased tremendously in value since he took office. Path to citizenship for illegals has increased to 1.8 million... I mean come on, how many more examples do I need to mention? Some of this was even in the video apparently you did not even watch but yet your commenting uneducated posts.
That’s really not true...
😅😅😅
gusdahlehhater comments like yours are what make people hate Donald Trump and believe his movement is backed by racism. I hope you know you’re part of the problem that fuels the extreme left.
All of you guys are just people who are ... Racist. The only “good” he has done was make people tug aren’t white look bad
I’m sorry but what did he do? All he’s done is divided America more then it was before.
Jaden Gavers what specifically has Trump accomplished this year that you think is so great?
First of all, to end this argument before it goes too far, Trump has done dan near nothing but stupidity so far. At least Barack knew how to NOT be a... I don’t even have the right word honestly. Plus, ALSO one year into his presidency we’ve already had a government shutdown. 

Second of all, “Look outside their echo chambers.” You’re kidding right? At least I hope, I’m not even going there. 

How about YOU look past your own so-called “echo chambers.” 

I’m done,
 I honestly cannot.
TRUMP is a commie. And you’re all commie sympathizers.  COMMIES

@NinerNation88 who will you vote for?
trueboss926 guys I don't want to get into an argument but I will not vote for him or did I vote for him but I don't hate him as much as I did I though he was the devil and let me tell you he isn't the total devil but is still the worst president in my eyes

The answer to your question 
People have a hard time over this because they do not spend the time watching the speech, they just skim titles or listen to what cnn says he said.
we are breaking the conditioning
How is it illegal? As President you can do anything you want as long as it doesn't violate the Constitution in any way. If he wants to do that to send illegal immigrants a message of hey, enough is enough go back home and make things right, than he has that right
Your clearly related to Ray Charles. Put your glasses on and pay attention to the democrats actions. Oh wait, there not doing anything. Not even clapping
Becuz hes a fkin RASIST CRIMINAL who SHUOULD B ASASINATED I HATE HIM hes a fkin he doesnt no what hes TALKING ABOUT u guyz are stupid becuz hes goin to BUILD a WALL and THATS ILEGAL
You're sane. That's probably why you weren't offended.
Nevermore You forgot one small thing. Most Americans won't see a difference in tax cuts until TAX SEASON.
Nevermore I am just wondering what other benefits western nations get that we don't get to enjoy?  You mean free healthcare?  Well for your information most people in those nations wait weeks to see a doctor and when you don't make wages competitive you end up with less qualified doctors.  Many from nations like Canada for example have to fly to cities like Pittsburgh for heart surgery because of the lack of qualified doctors there.  Yea we could donfree healthcare but definetely not Obama care and my ides is that maybe we should fix our nations debt most of which is due to the government dependance in the first place and after we can work on giving away free stuff.
Nevermore Clearly you speak as someone who has truly boughen into the idea of socialism.  Almost all Americans have received a tax cut myself included and from what I'm seeing I will save a few thousand per year.  Only 2% got raises?  Yea I'm sorry to burs your bubble but trump isn't in control of what corporations do with the tax cuts but most have plans to upgrade production, hire more employees etc so one would think you would be greatful to see this.  The economy was stagnant under Obama and is starting to grow rapidly under Trump as companies like Campbells and Dodge are bringing factories back to America.  Others will follow it doesn't happen over night.  The tax cuts and raises will help bring back business.  In turn more people will leave welfare and government dependence in turn bringing more tax revenue that will help balance out the cuts.  You are basically complaining that social programs(government paid programs via tax dollars)  will go away and I'm sorry but the working class doesn't want to pay for bums anymore.  The really needy people will still receive help but if you are able bodied you should be working so you can pay taxes and not leave it to the people who do work.  That is how a productive thriving nation works!
Nevermore but we have guns! kidding aside tho they can cut so much foreign aid that lowering taxes won't hurt us that much
I don't think it's a speech that's necessarily a problem but rather what he doesn't say. Only 2% of Americans saw a slight wage increase in pay since the tax cuts. It's just not as significant as they're making it out to be. But that tax cut will cost all Americans immensely in education, healthcare, etc to mostly benefit the top 1%... which it's unclear if they're even going to reinvest in America. Time will tell. But job growth under Trump's first year was actually slower than the final years of Obama's presidency. And there are signs that the cost of living may actually rise, cost of fuel, etc... so even if your pay rises... it won't help much as the cost of living may rise faster than your wage growth. That would be a catastrophe in an already underpaid, overstressed, overworked American society that sees virtually no benefits like other Western developed nations have.
Right guy is Paul Ryan, he probably js
What do you mean by paleness? Are you referring o the color of his skin?
ufewl 
You realise that Obama doubled our debt right?
No it has gone up about  $500,000,000,000 and is increasing. My facts are right. As to where is will be after the tax cut...
Bust and Reagun increase debt massively, Trump willl too, Clinton actually go it
The national dept has decreased under Trump. Get your "facts" straight.

I guess all countries in America are first then. AMERICA IS A CONTINENT
bossbear. That is definitely the dumbest thing I have heard in a very long time!
They didnt like him last election either and your point?
The media don't like trump so he isn't going to win that election this is it for him in all honest even Oprah has a better chance of winning than him
What language did you type this in
Toni       L. Hall he’s not a dictator
I've known of Trump since at least the early 80's, I don't recall him ever caring about anybody but himself.  He was never shy about this fact.   What universe do you live in?
From what you can tell...  What can you tell?   Genuinely curious.
What exactly is he doing that you love?   Honestly curious.
LolWut Grammarly, use it please.
Semper Fi Who is perfect? Is perfection now a standard?
Semper Fi Not one person is perfect. If you think they are?...You have not been educated rightly. I would say, you have been brainwashed.
Jared Jones Why do you hate the man? Do you know anything about the man? Other than what you've been told by the media? I'd really like to know where your thinking on this originates. You see, I've watched TRUMP since I was a child & he has always helped people who needed help...the little people like myself. He's always given to the less fortunate. Why would anyone hate this man? He's always done good for the less fortunate. I suggest you look up old footage of him & stop listening to propaganda against him.
jared jones. Hate him for what?
SHUTUP HES A RASIST and hes going to BUILD a WALL you shud HATE HIM 2
Jared Jones....I Love the man and what he is doing!
Finally, a comment i understand
Trump's not perfect, but as long as he's getting the job done, then I don't care. And from what I can tell, he's been getting the job done as president.
I think a lot of people feel this way.
Agreed.
In the case of Obama i can't think of anything that i like about him just to keep it real i disdain everything about the man
I don't hate Trump as a person, but he's definitely not perfect.
I'm sure most dreamers love America, and President Trump would like to give them a path to citizenship but democrats refuse to help.
To quote Obama, the US President Trump desperately wishes he was: "Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper"
They have SS numbers?
Gustavo Pena why wouldn't you be an American just because you're Hispanic.  there are Americans from all different backgrounds now. silly comment lol
Gustavo Pena no no, not American and you’re not Hispanic. What you are is a Traitor even if you’re a troll. Memorize that. Traitor. You sold out people and citizens on the promise of a buck and a buzz. You failed a litmus test by Cambridge Analytical and don’t even know it yet. Now u do. Enjoy the lesson. (90 days)
Gustavo Pena no one will assume your american anyways, especially with that name. And Hispanic is still “american” fool
Lol 😂 these ignorant people make me laugh, well I’ll talk to y’all later, I gotta get back to work. MAGA 🇺🇸
Derrick Burns, they CAN stay if they go through the process and become a documented U.S. Citizen.  just do it right and you won't think everyone is against you.  If they have been here since they were young, then they should have had plenty of time to become a legal citizen.  PERIOD !!!  if not, then leave.  sorry.
Liberal tears are beautiful just like a rainbow!! #MAGA
Gustavo Pena what is it with the im black or im hispanic? Does being a person of color some how make him a better president?
Fake account lol
Gustavo Pena sad
Gustavo Pena you truly are an American. Turn your back on your heritage as long as it benefits you.
Gustavo Pena: Amen brother!
if INS is reading this please deport Gustavo Pena
deport this man
JOSE B You are right sir. You are one.
Good man👌🇺🇸
Well Trump was never against Hispanics just illegal immigrants.
The defector is safe here in america.
Trump has talked down to a lot of his fellow GOP as well.  Usually in response to them just as he responds to the dems.
That’s exactly what he was put in office to do. Divide the American people. It’s called divide and conquer. It’s one of the oldest tricks in the book. You divide the Democrats and Republicans and then the whites, blacks and Hispanics with covert racism, and a small group can control the masses with ease like lions do with wildebeest.. it’s that easy. And those symbols beside the flag, the bundle of sticks and axe, are symbols of fascism. Most idiots will die with their eyes closed cause they can’t think for themselves.
Zetsumei278 Actually... that's what a liar does. Better yet, that's what a person who isn't confident in their values does.
Zetsumei278 The Republicans did attack him but there attacks were in most cases about things like economic policy or other beliefs where conservatives differ. They were also intermittent. Democrats/Journalists actually attacked him on a personal level calling him a nazi/racist, childish name calling (anything to do with tbe color orange, toupes, and small hands) bringing up false claims(gold shower peeing thing, russian collusion, etc), twisting or outright lying about his words(media said he didn't condemn the Nazis at Charlottesville, when in reality who condemned both sides), and so on. What Trump has received is much worse than anything Obama got. Not saying what Republicans  did was good but that doesn't warrant similar, or in this case even worse, treatment by Democrats. If they believe they are so much better and so "tolerant", why don't they treat Trump decently so that they show people they are better? I'll give it to you that Obama handled criticism pretty well but he didn't have to deal with the type of criticism that Trump did.
I point to Obama. Whether you agree with his policies or not, Republicans did nothing but attack him for all eight years (including some good ole false allegations) but he still showed them respect. He didn't constantly tweet attacking Republicans and senators, he continued to show them respect even though they did nothing but attack him. That is what a president does.
Zetsumei278 In what way did the Democrats respect him? They, along with the media, have been attacking him non stop with false allegations since he said he was running for president. If anyone is creating division, it is the Democrats and the MSM.
😂  Yeah......
Zetsumei278 are you watching the same thing I am? You dont think there's been any good policy changes?
"Democrat" party.  They are nowhere near being democratic.
In what serious way has Trump disrespected them that would merit not even standing for the national anthem?
How has he disrespected them?
max howard No you are not and no it is not.
They only had 6 states
Taking back their land? This is no longer their land, therefore they are in the wrong. America has laws and if you cant abide by those laws you must deal with the consequences. If illegal immigrants think they can come here without taking the necessary path then the United States government has everyright to treat them like the criminals they are and punish them. If Mexico feels they are powerful enough to take back their so called "land" then let them try, but sitting here saying they have some ridicoulous birthright is ludicrous. My family is from Cuba and they came here the right way, the legal way. There is no reason others cant do the same. No one in this world should be given anything, you must earn it. The only hypocrite here is the one who feels criminals should be put above true citizens. How about you give up your job and land to an illegal gang member since your such the cheerleader for them.
Justin Gutierrez So based on your logic every country has been conquered by foreigners at some point and that is how the "world works" and I should get over it, yet you idiots are complaining about Mexican foreigners taking back what was rightfully theirs 200 years ago? Hypocrisy and stupidity at its finest. BTW he considers chain migration as wrong yet his ancestors immigrated here so that makes him a chain migration hypocrite
truth beholds Donald is not a immigrant. He was born in the USA making him native to it. I understand your strongman arguement about how are ancestors "stole" this country but your stupidity ruined it. Do me a favor and take a look back in history and tell me what country hasnt been conquered by foreigners, its the way the world works. Did you think every race was born with the a country for themselves? Grow up 😂.
@SnowFaustMTS yeah that's what I mean, and Trump is the truth, Hillary would've let anyone come in and our country would be in a very poor state right now. The world we live in today is so family friendly and no one wants to hurt anyones feelings, its good that Trump says what he means. We need that as a country

No fun allowed
Why do you hate America so much?
IdleBigots 
Haha are you still mad killary isn’t president?
Sabastian Auth Listening doesn't result towards having it done. The president had the last choice of decision additionally sending bombs to other countries without the Congress consent. What we have here is a president that blutters what he believes without thinking about the consequences, he litterly bombed another nation without any though of notifiying Congress meaning that hes capable of doing whatever he wants without any restrictions.
Kenn 2222 Blaming the President where he clearly isn't calling the shots tells me you are unaware of how this administration works. They actually listen when the military generals tell them the best course of action. Sometimes the truth hurts. and war is a necessary evil.
Sabastian Auth Whats also scary is the fact that Trump past actions doesn't add up to what the purpose of his bombing was(or what he claims to be the reason why he bombed). First he promises to "bomb isis like crazy", then declears a travel ban for countries such as Syrian? The results of the bomb led to about 90 deaths including civilians that didn't want to be apart of any of this. While taking action to protect innocent children, he resulted in killing them as well.
Sabastian Auth I didn't miss the news, actually infact I watched it months ago. By the way, just because one Syrian Citizen agreed with his decision doesn't mean that all Syrians agree with him, infact, I recall other videos of Syrian Children that speak otherwise of Trumps decision.
Kenn 2222 I guess you missed the news that syrian refugees praised Donald Trump for standing up for them. Wouldn't you want to stay in your own country if possible? I know that I would.
Whats with the god bless? Im not even religious but does he honestly deserve to be blessed after bombing Syria and blame it on "innocent kids being murdered" for the reason why he took action?
Lossak Kernan Beware of your words. You need not question what Gods intentions are, rather pray for those around us and love our neighbor.

Marvin Pena God bless Mexico, amigo.
Why should god bless him? Why does god care? Doesn’t he have more important things to do?
And God bless you my friend! And God bless this great country
In what way
Apparently someone never had history class. The people changed, Liberals became Conservatives and Conservatives became Liberals.
Hike Masters Liberals fought as the south in the Civil War, and even started the KKK. But apparently conservatives are the racists, right?
Changing the topic? Nice.
i like how he lied the whole time too
Scott Genova lol.👎🏾
Scott Genova yes preach!!
Regarding the popular vote.  Check this one out.  10 counties in California had more votes than registered voters.  ????   The votes went to Hillary.  So, did Trump really lose the popular vote??  Maybe he didn't.  I still don't believe he is the most unpopular because the media says so.  People voting twice, dead voters voting.......Soros & The Clinton Crime Wave.  Don't trust either.  I trust Putin more than Clinton & Soros.
Scott Genova.  No actually you do apparently if you think this isn't true.  I'm not saying he's the worst president ever but he won by the smallest popular vote in history and is now the most unpopular President in history
No.....It is looking real good for Trump.  You watch too much fake news.
He's the least popular president in US history - not actually looking all that great for 2020
Hike Masters Yet another example of the ignorance we are so sick of hearing. We support Trump because he is benefiting the working class. The class that, for the last decade has taken extreme hits due the liberal party undermining the integrity of our country.
too bad, cause the 95 out of 121 republicans who used to support the party are now changing over to Democrat, which negates your 17...anyone supporting Trump supports racism, bigotry and misogyny......congrats!!
Scott Genova Democrats leaving in droves right now.
I have no idea why the Democrats keep around that bitter old crone
I think she forgot to use the denture glue
What dentures? She had to sell them after losing all that money by taking it to the bank after thinking President Trump would not be elected #MAGA

They do when Trump is claiming to represent that which he does not follow himself.
Libertarian atheist here, I can affirm the liberal atheists do in fact “REE” when that is said.
MysticFellow is that why it's the topic you're on 😂
Trump is turning the entire secular constitution on its head so he can bend over backward for his evangelical voter-base.  So many campaign promises and lies just to get into office, then he turns around and becomes a theocratic nightmare.
2 topics that breed stupidity: Religion and Trump
Conservatives have no claim to God. God is for all
I cannot wait for the memo!!!
tstanton_ _ it was an unbelievable speech he gave, the things trump is doing is legendary, like having apple invest 100s of billions into the United States. These people think Obama had something to do with it I'm sure just like how they do with the economy and black unemployment. They don't look into anything and lack common sense. They hate Trump and love being lied to by the msm. Trump could endorse air and these people would suffocate
What a great speech!
Did he claim responsibility, or did he just report it's at the lowest?  Rewatch that segment.
Being exposed is hella drug now.
Trump Should've Said More Like, "Obama Did A Great Job, Making Unemployment go Down, And Bringing Jobs To JEWmerica......I Can't Take The Credit"(Unquote).
Yes! I want to know. Reminds me of my son who voted for Obama....I asked him why and he said "I dont' know"!
UNO  some of those facts about unemployment low is wrong obama was the one to do that
Bandwagon
Mario mario like what?
Mario mario if you feel that way, you must be a welfare recipient.
Because so much of what he said was wrong
Because they have been proven wrong.
tstanton_ _ Because they didn’t actually watch the speech, They’re all just leeching off the bias media.
tstanton_ _ same thing I was thinking, like I held off because I saw people on Twitter talking crap, and I saw the thumbnail for Steven cobers video on it. But then I came here and watched it and it wasn’t even that bad... it was actually good
tstanton_ _  don't mind them. They're just stupid is all. They can't help it LOL

alex j Alex Jones is just funny. I don’t really care for the news. And Owen Shroyer is my ideal husband.
Zoe - do you like Joe Rogan? Peter was on his show in August. I’d give it a listen.
Zoe - Alex Jones is a delusional lunatic.  Do yourself a favor and check Schiff out, otherwise you’re not going to learn anything about what’s going on or WHY it’s going on.
alex j Yes and Alex Jones called 9/11. Doesn’t mean he’s right about everything.
Zoe - Do yourself a favor and listen to the Peter Schiff podcast if you want to get accurately informed. He actually called the housing bubble and 08 financial crisis.
alex j I don’t trust you over people certified in this field. Stop speaking to me.
Zoe - The problem is that most modern economists don’t follow the Austrian school of thought. They follow Keynesianism. The economy is not hard to understand and you’d be surprised how much of it is common sense. If you adhere to people like Paul Krugman you are getting misinformation. Check out Peter Schiff and Ron Paul.
alex j No, were done. You just called people who spent their whole lives studying these things “Idiots”.
Zoe - if you think the economy is so great, why hasn’t the federal reserve raised interest rates to historically normal levels? It’s because we’re still on “life  support.” We are so in debt as a nation that we can’t even handle normal level of  interest rates.
Zoe - most economists are intellectual fools who study Keynesian economics, which by the way is why the US economy is a total failure. Most of your beloved economists such as Paul Krugman never saw the 2008 crisis coming, even though it was blatantly obvious. Most didn’t even think housing was even in a bubble; they thought everything was great.
alex j https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/268967/trumps-economy-booming-matthew-vadum


Economists know more than you. Stop talking.
Zoe - let me know when our trade deficit actually comes down. 
That’s the key indicator of a failed economy, when you have a huge trade deficit. 
Trump has no chance of being re-elected because we are going to be in a worse crisis than 2008 in probably a year from now, if not sooner...not Trump’s fault, it’s more the fault of the federal reserve and all the stimulus deficit spending of the past. Trump is just continuing the same formula , however
alex j ...You’ve literally played yourself.

Trump is bringing manufacturing to America. That’s called “Preparation for a limited import/export economy.”
Zoe - That is why we can either default and restructure our debts, or inflate them away. It wasn’t an joke in Greece, but the US is in much worse shape than Greece.
alex j Yes the debt is a joke. No one will collect on the debt if we don’t pay it. We’d whoop China across the world and back.

And here, take a gander, because it’s not a bubble AT ALL. https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/economic-optimism-tax-cut-bonuses-trump-credit/
Zoe is doesn’t take an expert to analyze our phony bubble economy. And explain how the debt is a joke? you mean government debt?
alex j “I know more than people who’s jobs it is to analyze the economy”


The debt is a joke.
Russia the US economy is an allusion. We are just spending more low interest rate borrowed money. I don’t believe GDP is growing because I think the govt underestimates inflation. Also we have a lot more liabilities than assets. Our debt is growing faster than the alleged growth.
alex j 
Lower.
Business tax.

Great Speech Of Lies.
Nah
You obviously didn’t either
Only Foryou absolutely brother
Only Foryou, pretty sure Jesus would have a few things to say to Trump.
drewquixote You obviously didn't listen to anything in the speech.
Kai Baker, thats all it takes? Watch an elderly blowhard give a speech and now your a full blown patriot. Interesting
You educating him? This kid seems more intelligent than your entire bloodline. Also, using "Fake News" against those that made up the term, how childish. First off, atleast form a proper argument instead of pretending to have the moral high ground. Secondly, if you are going to accuse someone of a wrong doing, don't just sit there and say "I don't have the time/patience to educate you", because that means you have no idea what you are saying and you know you have to facts to back it up either.
He won because Americans were sick of the taxes. And trump is so patriotic and charismatic. Hillary didn't have that.
wot most people in America voted against Trump and he also couldn’t win without gerrymandering. So explain to me how he’s gonna win again? He only won because the Democrats didn’t provide a good enough candidate so many of them stayed home. And again he won due to gerrymandering.
I'd like to hear why he hates the president, not smug talk from over zealous Republicans. I like the Republicans, but I like civil discussions more.
IIIlllBravo Trump isn't going anywhere LMAO. He's president and will more than likely be re-elected in 2020. You still butthurt Killary Clinton lost ?? 😂😂
That's not sufficient. Explain to the internet why you hate the president. Unless of course you can't, in which case you should say so.
buddy i really don't have the time or the patience to educate you... it's just so obvious. I'll give you this bit of advice... dont watch FoxNews.
Upon what merits do you base your argument?
conceiving? Shakespeare why dont you try not make believe you know what you're talking about... whats there to "like" about your president. other than his promises to make this country great again.... which he really means is to make it only for the whites. dude you're so naive.
And you bravo, are incapable of conceiveing that people can like our president. And also if you'd like to publicly display your thoughts, do so in an elegant manner, and actually spell things.
your probably 52 what r u talking about.... trying to sway young new voters to vote for this douchbag .... young kids are smarter than that.. and besides hes going to either be impeached or forced to resign before the year s over. ... so keep seaching again for your great white dope.
Dude I'll be old enough next go around. He got my vote
if that ever happens which i doubt it will... all it takes is a $20 latter to climb.....  20 billion wasted over a $20 latter.. now how do you feel numbskull

TL M you would use an insult made famous by the dictator of North Korea. It's truly disgusting you would sympathize with the words of a leader of a oppressed nation, rather than the comforting, positive words of the president. If you had watched the full video you would realize there was a North Korean man, whose leg was cut off, and had to walk all through Asia to get to America. You spit in his face when you make remarks like that. You are pathetic
Lavenia Hewes you mean send illegal aliens home?
Lavenia Hewes let me ask you a question. What happens when you illegally go to Canada? Oh that’s right. You get DEPORTED! Why is it a problem when we deport our illegal immigrants it’s racist but everyone else can do it without backlash. Borderline hypocrisy.

Randomness Ivan  over 80% of Christians support Trump. We even have prophets speaking of God picking Trump to become the president years before he even decided to run. Also in the bible the apostle Paul was once Saul the murderer of Jews. God turned him into his servant, he has done the same with Trump. Notice how Trump always mentions God in his speeches.
A. Medina ur sped
Gary Jones is Obama  not a good man
Randomness Ivan No, Trump's a good man. He's trying to help get our country out of Obama's rut.
A. Medina Look... if you were a true Christian, you wouldn't support this man. It's as simple as that.
Protege024 Tell that to King David and Alexander the Great.
A. Medina God doesn’t care what human leader we have. Humans can never lead humans
A. Medina You said it, my brother.
Someone Else = sick commie
Amen baby ;)
Crack head
MrMadmanUSA   You are absolutely correct with what you said, I could not say it better myself. Your common sense and critical thinking is abundant. Trump 2020
Exactly my point, all the Trump supporters are fighting a civil war for him.  I wouldn't call them mental midgets but if you say so.  I respect your opinion though.  Stand up for what you believe in.
Marine1 Devildog Only a mental midget fights wars for eliteists. America hasn't been invaded, stupid.
Take a step back and look at the whole picture.  The economy was already recovering when Obama left office.  If the economy had taken a sudden slump the Trump admin would have pointed the finger at Obama.  That's the "I'll take the credit but not the blame" mentality..  The "temporary" tax breaks are just is way to toss the poor a crumb. The wealthy will benefit much more.  If you support Trump, more power to you. The majority of the country can see through the hypocracy though. We want a president that displays dignity, honor, respect and strong leadership.  That is worth much more than any amount of money he can hand out.
exactly!
Marine1 Devildog Pfft. 

“These people said this so it must be true”


That’s because Sams club has proven not to be that amazon of a business venture. And if you’re working a part time job, you’re not going to expect a massive amount of money. The fact that they’re making as much as they do now is just a testament to Trumps economy. 

Notice how you said nothing about any other company.

“Refusing to serve in a time of war” pfft. More like “Understanding there’s literally no evidence to support the fact that Russia interferes in the election.”
Walmart has given employee raises but is closing Sams Club stores across the country and laying off workers.  Most Walmart employees work less than 40 hrs/week anyway.  It's still hard to support a household with these entry level/part time jobs.  And just to bring you up to speed Congress voted unanimously to impose sanctions on Russia.  So we are well past the question of "did the Russians interfere?"  He is just afraid to stand up to Russia. Trump refused to serve his country in a time of war.  How much valor does the man have?....come on now....I respect your opinion but blatant ignorance is unacceptable.
Yes an eleven year Marine that is willing to die for your freedom.
I respect your opinion.  The tax bill is bread crumbs for the middle class compared to the five course meal that the 1%(wealthy) are geting.  He refuses to implement sanctions on Russia for interfering in our elctions.  He is either afraid of Putin or in business with him.  His loyalty is to money not the people.  I wish he would stand up to Russia, I wish he  would speak out clearly and passionately against racism , I wish he would stop demonizing people based on their race,  I wish he would treat women with respect.... but he hasn't done any of this.
I just don't like the guy. He seems... off. I mean you could say that about all politicians. But this guy is just gross and he does not deserve to be president.  Neither does Hillary but frankly I'd prefer her over this guy.
Are you eleven years old?
How has he done so? He's passed taxes to help people, he has kept all his election promises, and he has helped our country for the better. he does sometimes need to be quiet, but other than that, he's a good prez
washington also had slaves. don't make him out to be some kind of king
You also came to show your faggotry.  So much salt bro.
So sorry
Donald Trump he was but why would I show or say anything positive about someone with destructive political aims.
Thezebraherd Oh😂
Donald Trump Right now, it is definetly not the cleanest source of energy. Even natural gas is cleaner. There are far more cleaner and renewable ways we can generate electricity. There are solar plants in California that produce too much electricity. Coal is not, and never will be more efficient than the renewable resources.
Randomness Ivan well it is cheap and relative to what it used to be it is SUPER SUPER clean. So yes it is pretty clean because it doesn’t produce a lot of pollution and gases. It is a crucial time to remind competitive with the rest of the world with regards to energy and don’t worry the free market will get rid of coal in a couple decades because there are cheaper alternatives to coal. But we shouldn’t use government intervention to force it out of the market
Randomness Ivan I was saying coal is clean was one of his lies lol
Thezebraherd There is no such thing as clean coal. I don't know what you people don't understand about that.
There is literally no such thing as clean coal.
Kirksville Marching Band coal is clean his tax cuts are the biggest ever manufacturing jobs are coming back because of him (they were increasing Obamas entire second term)
You realize almost all president speeches are written for them
Lilith factually speaking, he was a very good orator. So you could say his speeches were good.
work has been done over the last year
Imagine if someone said Im not even a Hitler supporter but he gave a good speech, some of u need to grow up lol
Thank you MostBeast234
You are a trump supporter, meaning YOU sir need to grow up.
Michael Scofield what wasn’t true
The bar for a good speech has been set really low.
Michael the stock market went down after a fake news story about trump, then it went up. Not related to Trump?
anybody that isn't hillary clinton would be better than Obama.
Olivia Seong u ain’t real. ur a real traitor. to human kind. lol dummy
MAGA!! I love the U.S.A. and Trump too!!!!!!!!!
Garrett Henninger building the wall is going to cost billions! And it won't stop illegals coming in from planes, under ground passages and will cost the tax payer heavily.
Olivia Seong by polluting our country and having short term economic growth that will eventually lead to a all out resource war killing millions from starvation dehydration and disease.
Ghost Purp oh my god a political leader made a claim they couldn’t back up? But that can’t be.. they can’t lie.. he must be the first one to ever lie.. Grow up. Every presidential candidate in our modern history does it. He’s getting the wall built. He’s making good on the promises he’s made. Something Obama never did and that quack Bernie and Hillary could have never done.
Citation needed
If you get no replies trying to educate you & bring you back to reality, then that means we have given up on you. Sorry
You claim Obama has done nothing, but what did Trump spend his first year trying to get rid of?
Id love to see mexico pay for it but highly doubt that will happen since hes said no a bunch of times to the public until then trump is a lier and he went back on his word. Md you cant say I'm wrong cuz its completely factual.
It is but checknot out..what happen to mexico paying for the wall? Isnt that what was suppose to happen? Obviously he lied and went back on his word.
Ghost Purp perception vs reality, it is a thing
Olivia Seong your sticking up for the guy who's trying to put all the dreamers who know nothing sept this country out of this country. You support a guy who believes climate change isn't real 😂...donald trump has lied to you but yet you still support a man that lies to you haha what a fool you are
You’re cute
Olivia Seong  than*
bench550 Much like Republicans all throughout Obama's Presidency. I'm just saying. I don't claim Rep or Dem,... I'm an American. And I hope that God will bless and guide our leaders regardless of who they are.... Trump bugs me, but I think (and God knows we the people don't Really know), I think he's doing good things...
Dems are like the passengers on a plane that want to remove the orangatang that's holding the real pilots hostage would be a more suitable anology.
Yes
billiam braskey According to 73% of Americans his the worst president in history.
*According to illegals, i'm sure he is.  To us Americans, one of the best presidents in history.
Hike Masters also he payed/pays more in taxes than either Hillary or Bernie, and at a higher rate
Hike Masters read the memo

That's funny, when I see news articles with Trump mentioned (good or bad, every single one), the comments are overrun with negative comments like yours. If the article is about anything else political, it's a much more balanced or even positive leaning ratio. Either you guys are a bunch of brigading clowns, getting extra credit from your commie professors for commenting, or the bots are on your side!
djbiggyb and YouTube is using a dislike bot. It's already been admitted that the Russia situation was all fake.
The Russia story is fake news u not woke😓
the accounts that posted the highest rated comments on this video that have no profile picture and two names in their user have zero activity on their profile. not one liked video, not one playlist, not one upload. all of them.
But but but, Russia. Waahh. These are true Americans that love this nation and want it to succeed. Take your Russia bs somewhere else.
Yu Chen omg that's hardcore

luckyfingers1213 I have a 21 year old son who's been working since he was 13 years old and now earns $19 an hour. I have an 18 year old daughter who just started working part-time and is earning $9 an hour.  How you're 54 years old and never earned more than $10 an hour is incomprehensable. Did you ever try to learn a trade? Did you ever try to start your own business? I would encourage you to read rich dad poor Dad, and not give up. Believe in yourself. It's never to late to turn it all around. This country is full of opportunities for people who refuse to have that victim mentality. You can do it. I believe in you.
Micah Wright lol...exactly.
Cupcake Cookie right!!!
First learn the definition of racist lol
Cupcake Cookie not clapping doesn’t make someone racist
rockingroxy456789 and speaking of blind folds are you still in the dark about how corrupt the Clintons are?!?! Lol 😂 you want a crooked criminal murderer and thief in office. You must be trolling me.
Trump is nothing? Well, if being a billionaire and being elected President, while having to fight both establishment parties is nothing I sure I hope I'm that much of a nothing someday. You're a vapid git to say something so ridiculous.
Cupcake Cookie take off your blind fold and wake up honey, trump is nothing and is simply just taking credit!!
72marshflower15 that’s funny considering the democrats created the KKK! Oh the irony
"Racism is raceless"?

"Racism is focusing on a race"?

"little understandable sense"?

Capitalizing every word?

This entire thread is pure gold! Please, all of you, just stop! 😂💀
I Say the One Whom Thinks, Black People Are Stupid-Lazy People, One, President Donald Duckfatfuck Trumputa. +Cumcake Rookie....BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!
72marshflower15, your comment is contradictory to its own statement and makes very little understandable sense. As what I've seen from your different replies amongst different comments, I will make an educated guess and say you have a habit of copying and pasting quotes from different websites and putting them as your own.
The Dems have always been the party of racism. Race is what they focus on. That's the definition if racism correct? They want to keep certain races of people on the "political plantation" so they... the "Owners" can use them and get rich as quickly as possible. 

From their perspective, lying and manipulating easily beats investing money, starting a business, competing, working long hard hours, and getting wealthy the good 'ole fashioned American Way.
72marshflower15 

Not trying to spam comments here but one more thing:
What you said is like me saying, "Individualism is individualless." Like wtf is that dude.
72marshflower15 

Hey, sunshine! You said; "...racial likeness..." Please educate me on the difference between that and just simply saying, "one's individual race"?
Cupcake Cookie No it's not you. I read: "Racism is raceless..." And that right there flagged everything there after. I even went on a little field trip, to Google, to look up this word 'raceless' in a Thesaurus, and that word does not even exist. 

...But I digress. After stating an imaginary word stating racism is 'raceless' he/she includes a description of racism by saying: "...intolerance of those outside ones individual racial likeness." 
 
Idk what was meant by the lone words "Individualism, source of conservatism"
Micah Wright Phew! I’m not the only one! I thought maybe I was hallucinating (I’m sick and have a fever) or something.
72marshflower15 Your comment makes little sense
And you are a racist.  Why do you choose to live in a country that is majority white?  Oh yeah, because if you went back to your native land you would be living in a mud hut.

Phoenix Down if a President (Obama) wasn't FOR our Constitution and our American principles wouldn't YOU feel the same way too?
Phoenix Down It feels okay because it was no where near the way and the childish as the Democrats in this speech. They literally booed at the parents who's kids died because they were killed by illegal immigrants. It's digusting.
As opposed to what Republicans did during Obama's speeches? Lmao. How does it feel?
Thinh Vo yeah I get that but honestly what about all the other things. About the humongous debt that America had and now because of his policies it's changing? Thank you for your answer I'm not really looking for a discussion but it really frustrates me how people just hate a person just because the media portrayes him in some ways instead of looking at what he really wants to accomplish you know? P.S I enjoy your profile pic. Cheers
PikayOsh Maybe like two of the Democrats applauded what you said, the rest sat.
Thucket Bucket, You are on literally every comment. Take a chill pill and relax. Nothing you say anybody cares about and it ain't changing anything.
Ambar Marshall because you can see its reflects in the statistics, the black unemployment rate only decrease by 1% during the beginning of his administration, you know? The time WHERE NONE OF HIS ECONOMIC POLICIES WERE STILL IN EFFECTS AND IT WAS STILL OBAMA POLICIES? But yeah let say its trump accomplishments because why not? Obama during middle of his first term all the way to the end of second term decrease black unemployment rate by 12% through smart and common sense policies.
Pantzer101 I’m a democrat and I agree. It’s very childish. This whole meeting screamed childish.
Thucket Bucket genuine question.  How do you know that?
He’s taking credit for stuff that has nothing to do with him...
Freddy Krueger ...*looks back at when Obama got elected*
Republicans are bitchy? Do we throw tantrums, and protest when we lose an election?
Thucket Bucket what isnt true?

What damage 2.4 million jobs created the record high stock market record low unemployment across the board American small business confidence at an all-time high securing our nation again I repeat what damage
So it is considered bad for black unemployment to be at an all time low? You are a racist. The defeat of Isis is considered bad? You are a terrorist supporter. Tax cuts is considered bad? You are a supporter for a financial dictatorship. You believe that the democrats should undermined our republic? You are a treasonous sympathizer.

Quite frank I can keep going on and on about the type of person you are but no one takes a person with a minecraft profile picture seriously so go play with your legos kid.

U spelled Hillary wrong 😅
Michael Collins have you even been paying attention to all the good Trump is is doing mate?😂
libertarian all the way, lower taxes than the GOP and more socially liberal than democrats, best of both worlds
No One there are biological reasons for the left and the right and they both play a crucial role in society. 

You may as well ask that people stop having different temperaments that align in certain patterns. Good luck with that, bro.

undrtakr900 What laws did immigrants from Europe break when migrating to North America, to make them illegal immigrants?? Answer: none 
Why?: Because the native Americans did not have an established civilization. There could be no such thing as "illegal" in their tribal era. However, there was a giant land fued, where they constantly slaughtered each other on behalf of land. In fact, in that day and age, pretty much every nation was fighting each other over land... 

Not only did we try to negotiate with the Native Americans, but we also created laws preventing expansion Westward to allow the Native Americans to live
this is a very good and nice speach from our presdent, Greetings to you all ,My name is Mrs Lastri,i want you to help me in reaching out to the poor and needy in your country so if you are ready get back to me so that i will give you the full details here is my email(budicares @gmail.com
).Have a nice day and hoping to read from you soon.Yours Mrs Lastri Budi.
lol the natives where too busy fighting themselves to ever come together to fight invaders. We did them a favor... and back then you take what you can for yourselves at others expense. If you don't want your land taken then defend it. If you loose atleast you died trying...
john187a 
Did you forget that America was founded by illegal immigrats from Europe, who stole this land from Native Americans?
Seize the means of Production 

What "cheaply sold food are you referring to"? Like specifically I want to know besides flordia oranges 🍊
Seize the means of Production It's Prices also rise due to capital gain because people have more money to spend.
Micah Wright actually it's the result of not having cheaply sold food (from illegal immigrants) I don't see how that is economic growth
Haha
Seize the means of Production That's called economic growth.
What about Republican dreamers

SMOKE KIT no it’s Reagan
Bison Jobs: U.S. filings for unemployment benefits plummeted to the lowest level in almost 45 years, the Labor Department reported Jan. 18. The figures suggest the unemployment rate of 4.1 percent, already the lowest since 2000, could be poised to decline further, Bloomberg said.
Tax reform: Trump praised Apple’s announcement that it will repatriate overseas cash holdings and pour $350 billion into the U.S. economy over the next five years, saying his policies allowed the tech giant “to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,” which is a “huge win for American
drewquixote Judging someone on their views? How childish...
Accomplished what exactly? Gimme one thing he accomplished.
SMOKE KIT its Reagan...
I am also 18 and I couldn't agree more. I have lived in Atlanta Georgia (Republican) and Chicago Illinois (Democrat) and now in Orlando Florida (Mixed) and I can say this president will be one of the better presidents in history. I have heard all sides and the democratic party has lost all of its values and common sense. Most people our age is a blank canvas that could be died any color. They don't understand nor care about this stuff.
Why did Reagan raise taxes 8 times? Why did he illegally sell weapons to Iran? Why is every Retardlican on here unable to even SPELL REAGAN correctly? Not one of you has an IQ over 100 and each one of you has no idea what you're talking about yet loves to parrot each other because you think you're right because you heard the same dumb stuff from your mom and dad and uncles and church shatheads. It's so amazing how dumb you are even for an 18 year old. AMAZING!
tyler shoemaker What exactly has he accomplished?
Youll figure it out as you gain more expierence, you get a free pass for being young
Lol I didn’t notice it my phone did it autocorrected wrong lol
tyler shoemaker I’ll give you benefit of the doubt
tyler shoemaker I agree with you Bub but please spell right... it’s Regan.
then you love and support bigotry, misogyny, racism & his serial lying.....congrats!
up where?
Trump 2020
Wrong, the majority of people in American love Trump, AND voted for him.  Just a bunch of fictitious BS
That has been proven wrong.  Killery did not win the popular vote and further evidence has been revealed to show that over 800,000 votes were cast for dead people in Killery's favor.  What what you say no?????
But no one likes him tho
And yet most people in America hate him and voted against him......”people’s president”
Bison who is then?
The illustrious Boba the Fett "love it or leave it" is unAmerican per the "we the people" founding...

Besides, where could any American go? Most are too poor to leave and most of the world doesn't like America anyways... 

If everyone else is the problem, then maybe it's not everyone else who's the problem...
he may be the president but he's basically the figure head his son dose everything
Bison YOU'RE a US citizen so he is 😂😂😂
Craig W. Actually Hillary Clinton won the popular vote so not really the people's President.
Craig W. Not my president 😂
She probably threw the ones away that she disagreed with. Don't bother doing assignments like those. <Life hack for you
Maximillian Kelly . The reality escapes most. The false statements fly so fast that we've given up on fact checking. He's playing off on people's emotions of patriotism and looking to bribe the working poor by cutting some taxes to buy votes for 2020 while simultaneously stuffing big oils pockets.... 
I HOPE he puts his money where his mouth is in sustainable jobs that transition our country into a strong nation. 
I'm appalled by this man's character. We can all learn so much now and support where we can and take action to forward our neighbors.
Obama was a limp wrist empty suit who sold the american people out.  But nice try bro, that salt must burn so bad.
more like one year olds throwing temper tantrums and pouting maybe give them all bottles so they quit whining.

Living life as Ashley you actually made one of the most intelligent comments I've read. it's ok not to like someone, but to hate someone to the point that you can't see past that hate is never a good thing. Unfortunately some adults can't seem to see past their own hatred. Your parents should be proud of you as you can look past your dislike and still recognize when that person does something right. That takes maturity. I'd have never guessed you were only in 7th grade. hope you get an "A" on your assignment. 😉😉
Living life as Ashley , the hate him because they are hate filled people. Democrats are thd party of hate. I am talking of elected Democrats, not rank and file Democrat voters.

Quite a bit of the pro-Trump comments are made by bots as well as trolls. I personally know people that make accounts to "support" Trump because it's the easiest way to troll now
People just dislike and leave
Yeah.... people dont like his personality, Hes racist which has been proven so many times, calling other countries shithole countries doesn't make you likable.

Are trump supporter racist ?
I will never vote for Trump b/c gun control to me is more important than the economy and any other policies that’s going to benefit me... I STAND WITH ALL THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO DIED CAUSE OF GUNS...
You broke free of the brainwashing, congratulations!
aze606 What you said was racist.
a white racist pretending to be latino. amazing
Hilarious! If Trump saw you standing in the corner, he would ask no questions and have you deported. Latinos that support Trump are like African Americans at Tiki torch rallies.

Congrats bro!.  Similar here!
Ghost Purp as stated by Mr. Rednexus, he never claimed mexico would hand over a billion+ dollar check for the wall. I always interpreted "mexico will pay for it" as "im going to raise tariffs on mexico to get money to cancel out the cost of the wall"
Victor Felix I can smell it too...
Now if only Latinos in California would get it...California is a sh*thole
Ghost Purp we still give money to Mexico 320 million per year in foreign aid. We can cut that, plus tax there imports to us. Bamm...shazamm...Mexico pay for the wall
There kind of are paying for it, but in actuality where the ones doing it.
Fake account
As far as I know your never suppose to trust or believe somebody like that.
He went back on his word and lied about to us about mexico paying for it
Ghost Purp what did he lie about? I can obviously tell that, you did not watch his speech at all.
Just Another Mom and as sad as that is, it’s just a perfect example of the fact that, it’s not necessarily the guns, but the ones who wield them. Can’t blame a car for hitting someone if the driver was drunk, can’t blame the gun if the wielder had lethal intent :/
Keep up the good work man! The lights don't power themselves!
Nunya Binness Bots
Menmen I85 I just wanted you to know I am not a bot and that I keep it real. That's why I replied. As for the accusation of being a KKK member, I have no idea where you got that. Unless you mean I am a Kool Kid Keeping it real. In that case guilty as charged. ;)
Master Shake : I am sure you are keeping it real, :) with you'r KKK buddies. What is the point of even replying OMG. Troll !
Shirley : YES, and I finally found - how incoherent people are. starting with my dear Shirley.
Billy Ocean : Do you even know what are American values ? 

Watching too much FOX new, am I right Mr. Billy ? Paint anyone who don’t agree with you as a communist is the trick of Fox News. 

How will you define Love for American values? Where is the measurement ? 

I think you need to start self-reflecting on your comments. Before you replay.
"Next Level" i guess are always one level down. who said democrat's are winning. by the way democrat are not my team, America is my team. where you live must be pretty white with KKK. Like it or not. Problem is there are less whites who are not resist.  so your point on "democratic leaders are ALL WHITE!" is just playing trump (less white people that are not resist.. Get it..!). 

If you done have something productive to add. not don’t reply I understand. try to comprehend the initial comment before replying please.
Bill Bryant : Thank you bill ! ... Really appreciate your maturity, ow wait you sent a half Nazi (KKK) and half womanizer to be the president of the greats country on earth. tells a lot about you.
Finally! I found the dumbest comment on this video.
Menmen I85 What made you become a communist? Have you always hated America? At what age did you start hating American values?
Master Shake i like you
Menmen I85 keep telling yourself that if it makes you think your team is winning! In reality your team is down by thirty and just got dunked on! Where I live you can't go 200 miles in any direction and find a democrat! As much as YOU want to make this about race the American people disagree!  Btw in case you haven't noticed the democratic leaders are ALL WHITE! No cure for stupid sorry
Menmen I85 💩
I'm a real guy just trying to keep it real. ;)
Two things, you can be a troll or a bot (don’t see any activity on your account), if not Congratulations to you and enjoy that! …and the rest of America (none white, immigrants who came here legally) will need to deal with Authoritarian nativism
I don't know about you but I got some juicy tax breaks, for a mid class simpleton. ;)
You mean the tax breaks for Corporate America!!!...., This is a classic example of not having the mind to understand or comprehend the issue (settle for scraps). You just proved my point.
Turn that frown upside down baby! We all got tax breaks (including black and brown people)!
Matt Corey Still better than Hillary
😂😂😂
He needs a booth
Matt Corey  Good comment.  Funny old Socialist hack.
And every time I respond with facts, Republicans change the subject or come back with "clever" quips or, in this case, both.

....but I'm capable of handling this too.

You see, I'll make approximately $19,584 this year. I live in Denver where the average cost for a small, studio apartment is $1,200+ per month. Thank goodness I at least live in a state that raised minimum wage to $10.20 this year. Even at that, $19,584 - $14,400 (rent) - $758 (taxes) = $4,426

....but we're not done.

$4,426 - $3,540 (child support) = $886. Divide that by 365 and I'll have roughly $2.43 per day to live on. Its America, so I still have freedom of choice. I could choose lights, heat or water, but not all at the same time. I definitely can't afford school as it costs $2.60 just to get on a bus or train to get to a community college near me. I definitely qualify for food stamps, but an unlit or unheated home isn't fit for a child, so I would imagine that, sometime in the very near future, I will lose my remaining over-nights with my son and my child support will go up. 

On the other side of the conversation, concerning my son's mother, what DJ omitted from his SOTU address is that the additional $1,000 increase for the child tax credit is for married couples only. You know, people that already have lower costs of living just by sharing a home and utilities. My son's mother will see only $75 additional as she is a "single mother." (I don't really believe in that phrase, but so be it.)

Just because families separate, it doesn't mean they aren't still families. Our child still has a mother and a father that love him very much and want the best childhood for him, as any parent wants for their child/ren.

That being said, I won't have any money to contribute to any politician at the rate I'm at. A pay raise of just $1.03 qualifies me for readjustment and my child support goes up as his mother is at minimum wage also.

We don't need a couple of extra dollars a day. We need a livable minimum wage. $10.20 is a step in the right direction, but it still falls quite short of making ends meet.

I get it. You're a Republican and that's the party you'll vote for. But understand this: when you oppose livable wages, either directly or by means of circumvention such as miniscule tax cuts, you are, in fact, giving the welfare state credentials and no one I've ever met wants to be on welfare in any form. The trips to the offices, the endless paperwork and the routine updates are vexing to say the least.

Tax cuts aren't the answer. Livable wages and across-the-board tax credits are.

I've lied about nothing and I've omitted nothing. This is all fact. This is my every day life.
Well then Jim, I have an idea.  Give the extra money you get back in taxes this year to fund a democratic nominee for the next term.
I'll reply with some facts.

Referring to the "We haven't seen new auto manufacturers building plants in the US in decades" comment in the state of the union address, several FORIEGN automakers have built new plants in the U.S. in recent decades, including Toyota, Honda, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Volkswagen. All of these were before the Drumpf administration. The toyota-Mazda joint venture will be the only new expansion under the current administration....and that hasn't even happened yet.

Trump supporter: Trump is responsible for bringing manufacturing to the US.

Me: *Leans into the mic* WRONG!
everytime i ask them to show proof they never respond ;(
n .0 Care to share proof? Oh wait, you’re allergic to it.
He's done a real great job being a sexist, racist, nepotistic, dillusional, incompetent bigot.
REEEEE
Andrizzle8 traitors are fed to gators?
In fact, he may already be the best ever..
Andrizzle8 I may actually agree with you, we'll see after his 8 years if he was actually better then Abe Lincoln. He might become the best ever, so far he's on his way
Andrizzle8  He seems to be well on his way! #MAGA
Greatest of all time 👐
Andrizzle8 😃
Trump order more Bots last night.
I am beginning to...he is certainly doing a great job under the circumstances.
#RiseUp #JULIOOOOOOOOOOO
TARRPF You guys can go first.
K
He will be known as 1 of the greatest presidents of all time.
You wait and see who is lying. Libs have been lying to you from the beginning. You will see America become wealthy, and many lower and middle-class people move up, regardless of color. Watch and see.
thedvguy closest comparison would be Reagan, outside of that you'd have to reach back hundreds of years.
somebody put something in his mouf my zipper stuck
The Vindicator Nope, it’s actually a fact ;)
Ghost Purp that’s YOUR opinion
Jesus man, you must be a year old
thedvguy too a he is actually the worst president in American history...facts!
Magnus Christianssen Get ready for Trump 2019 Recession.
Dragenn Get ready for Trump 2019 Recession.
No one can.  That’s what I thought lmfaooo
Eavesdropz nearly all of them have everything to do with diet. Our so called, “healthcare system” is not really designed to promote health at all. It’s mostly a matter of prescribing chemicals to suppress symptoms, or surgery. That approach should be reserved for acute injuries. Chronic illness and disease are a result of multiple injuries to the body, and modern medicine is not designed, nor is it strong enough to keep up with the damage. The system rarely ever treats the initial causes. Acute injuries, bacterial infections and viruses, are about it. I posted numerous resources that will explain that, and the majority of them are medical doctors. Just one among many examples of how diet has a lot to do with disease, Dr. Ruth Heidrich, PhD. Reversed her stage 4 breast cancer by switching to a whole food plant based diet and exercise. It had metastasized to her liver, lung, and bones. I could go on and on, but since I’ve already provided several recourses, I’ll just leave it there. If you won’t look into them, then I guess you can just remain in the dark about it. I pray you will though.
Pertaining to your comment addressed to screaming mimi's..you literally said in your original post "healthcare is not a human right"
A right defined by terms from Blacks Dictionary of Law and by a student of APUSH, i will say that a right is defined as an objective standard of human existence. Disagree? No, you cant. Objective means factual, and standard is something that is basis; it is truth. This is what i right means.
Is health care a right then? No, it is not.
Is the ABILITY to enact processes to receive health care a right? Yes. It is.
Edit : I should be A*
You are only touching on your thoughts about the health of Americans with diet related health issues. As Iasked before what about those with autism? Cancer? Other diseases that have nothing to do with diet?

And I have a truckload of resources, from the minority of medical doctors in this country that actually understand how to heal the body, to back up what I am saying.
Denise Chavez , even if what you said is the case, if health is a right, then that still doesn’t change my conclusion because if it is a right, then people should get educated about nutrition and take better care of themselves. Eat healthier foods or grow a garden. The real problem is though, that the people are being lied to about what real health is, which is why we’re in the mess we’re in. Healthcare would be much more affordable if the truth were told to the American people.
What you actually voted for, was a continuation of a corrupt system that is more interested in profits than it is Health. Most medical doctors are not taught how to cure anything. They are taught how to give out drugs to people in order to suppress symptoms. They rarely ever take care of the cause of the problem, and that is why so many Americans stay sick. We have a healthcare crises because of greed. It’s not the doctors’ fault, so much as it is the authorities that run the system. If doctors actually knew about nutrition and how to use it as treatment, we wouldn’t be in this mess, this expensive crisis would be done away with, and the kind of healthcare you really deserve would be affordable. Also the majority of care we would need would be for life saving, emergency situations, and caring for disabilities.
Screaming Mimi's I didn’t say healthcare was a right. I can’t tell if you’re agreeing with me or arguing.
Randy what of those with Autism or other severe handicaps? Just take away their healthcare too?
Screaming Mimi's adequate nutrition is considered as one of the important factors to help support the right to health according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Rightly so, they don’t advocate for it to be free for everyone, as the right to work is also considered a Universal right, so everyone can afford to eat.
Ninth Amendment:
The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

The constitution is not a full or detailed document. Even the constitution admits that not every single “right” is mentioned. It’s so vague, that judges can interpret it in different ways. But the founding fathers meant for this document to be vague and incomplete because they wanted the States to retain power (see ten amendment). 

According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (article 25), every person has the right to health. The article gives a detailed explanation of why we all have that right and what it entails. The United States signed this Declaration in 1948, and adopted it, as many countries in the world have done. The creation of this Universal Declaration was done in an international manner because every person in the world has rights no matter where they live, they’re called inherent rights. The UDHR is meant to protect people even from their own governments. Its kind of like a universal system of checks and balances. Anyways....hope this information somewhat helps to understand the right to health.
Yeah let's your family die and the rest us can lived. Oh yeah we already voted to make sure your family won't die. Your welcome!
Randy Hughes True.  If healthcare is a human right, then food is a human right and should be free to everyone.
Trevor Manning Dreaming for trump 2020
Repeated comments.
SPIKOR. I doubt it... and I’m pretty sure republicans don’t have the right idea either
K. Flynn The thing is, the degree that Democrats are at to oppose Trump is getting ridiculous. When Obama was President, Republicans didn't like him, sure. But the Republicans gave him a chance. For 8 YEARS. If Republicans can withstand Obama for 8 years, why can't you give Trump a chance for even 1 year. Hear the guy out. See what he has to offer this country before you make any name-calling or insults.
JJ 71919 He's in collusion with a Russia Mr patriot
JJ 71919 the democratic party is right in this situation.. Juat saying Donald trump is a horrible human being..no man should be president if they are being accused of sexual assualt, and to even think that he had Russia to interfere in our presidental election and lien to the american people about alot of things is totally wrong and they never should of let this man into politics period and he should never of been left into the presidential race for the stuff hes being accused of.
JJ 71919 They are agent provocateur saboteur fanning the flame of hatred and violence in this country the sooner they are gone the better the country will be i can never recall in my lifetime of living in this great country the Dems giving people a hands up They always out to victimized people
JJ 71919 trump set them up masterfully.....he made them show their true colors and it was awesom. #hooklineandsinker
Eavesdropz 

Tell that to the Democratic Party in that House, please.
Jonachris Ching Trump’s wife hates Trump. It’s super messed up. I mean there’s no hardcore evidence, but it’s clear to see by her actions and words she dislikes him.
Manu GOATbili No one said that. The democrats in that address are anti-Americans. Now go get a tissue and wipe those tears from your eyes.
He hides behind patriotism and you all buy right into it. He has the young and naive fghting for him when they should be fighting for their American brothers and sisters.
Nikolos M hey the republicans do a lot of that to. During the Obama administration, for about a year, the republican senate refused to pass any laws, even politically neutral laws, presumably because of Obama. They did not clap, like the Democrats do today. 

Politicians hate it when they loose, no matter the party
Nikolos M neither is trump
JJ 71919 didn't Republicans shout at Obama during his sotu? What does that make them?
Am sure the first lady is anti american cuz she's late and didn't even stand.
Making up lies and causing racial tensions, disagreeing with everything the president says no matter what, calling him racist off of assumptions, disrespecting the flag, and acting like their on the high ground, yeah. I'd say they aren't the most respectful people.
serves the country everyday = hates said country

they can resign you know, they do this with their own free will.
Right... cuz The ENTIRE Democratic Party is Against America 😐, And I thought Bush Supporters were bad
Bootybutts your "life" is 101% salt.
Still a great speech regardless...
The speech was 50 min and the stalling was another 20-30min
Bootybutts more than clapping He deserved a standing ovation for the hard work and a job well done
There's a lot to clap about. Thank God for President Trump
Bootybutts rightfully so
@Zoe Actually, your comeback is invalid, as it has nothing to do with my credibility whatsoever. What does follower count have to do with anything? I directly responded to your ironic comment of K-Pop when your anime avatar hails in comparison to Asian fads. Don't try to act smart. And by the way, this isn't a Republican thread. This is a free-speech thread. The least you can do is respect someone else's opinion. Just because it doesn't align with yours, doesn't make it wrong.
ISE Gaming Says the guy that has a gaming channel with 18 subs.
@Zoe, says the account with an anime sketch profile picture. Get something better to do with yourself, please.
You listen to K pop so your opinion doesn’t matter
Your handle is stupid.
They’ve obviously never heard of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt or FDR XD
He's the greatest and he replaced the worst. Thank God for President Trump
Patricia Speicher you have to spamming us right? This country has been through a revolution a civil war and 2 world wars a depression a recession....and this guy is the greatest?
I've been saying it for a while now people hate Donald Trump because he's a white male pure and simple , that's all it is
Lol
Exactly
Ghost Purp didn't happen.
Michael Scofield He literally introduces bills and such to improve the country.
sarahreagan54 tusolotu
maybe learn to read charts and graphs and then post one for us that shows what happened between 2008-2018. Dare you to do it for anything you think has gotten magically better all of a sudden. You people are all clowns with little to no education.
John R. Timmers your ststement is wrong their mad cuz he's doing alot of people wrong! What kind of people who stand up nd clap for the man who put 32 million people off of their health care. #republicans
Jeremy Davis Did you just quote Batman to describe Trump? Cuz thats an insult to Batman. Batman for President 2020.
The technology is out of control. Meanwhile some sit and do this while babbies that are not babbies but adults with fragile attitides and big with access crumble america to the ground and very proud of it. We have the real world proof to prove it. Trump will make america great by following a simple plan.

I know this is hard for you to believe, BUT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good that is happening in US is because of Trump.

US government operates just fine without a president, all the stuff you see US does is not because of Trump, in fact saying so is a retarted statement.

"People are getting more educated and they receive more jobs", Trump supporters be like " SEE !? SEE !?!? TRUMP IS AWESOME!!", even tho he literally did nothing to change it.
John R. Timmers Saying things are getting better isn't the same as it actually happening, that's what we call alternative facts 😂.
Jared Jones actually, all of Obama's success was due to George W. Bush.  (This is how stupid your argument is)
Trump is the president we need, but God knows we don't deserve.
Employment being up is mostly a factor of Obama. Republicans were upset with him at the beginning of his presidency, because the stock market was down and jobs were a thing people needed. By the end, they were at and all time high. The first year reflects very little on the current president
Thucket Bucket you don't need to focus on the stupid people.
John R. Timmers like what? Seriously answer this, and no, the stock market didn’t go up because of Trump.
You are a complete tool.  The man has worked his whole life building empires, while you sit and smoke blunts and collect welfare.
J mayo jimmy "cry while you lie" kimmel.

The Champ fun fact, if you're a liberal who thinks it's a good idea to do a "take a swig everytime you get triggered" drinking game, you'd die in the first 1/4 of the vid. 





Good riddance
IdleBigots Yep bc he forced and asked people to clap. Man democrats are so intelligent.
IdleBigots no sadly only Jimmy Kimmel needs those lol
The Champ 🤣
You could basically have Trump hold up an 'applause' sign whenever he thinks he said something clever.  Arrogant and ignorant.
The Champ I love this comment XD
Maybe you should've actually listened to the speech instead of just the clapping lol.
Hillary will never see even 22 seconds of clapping that wasnt paid for using dnc funds.
The Champ HAHAHAHAHHA BEST COMMENT
Joseph Kitchens, keep turning people away from God. I hope one day you see errors in your lifestyle. God bless, even if you are a smug hypocrite
i hope you see the errors i your life style and change
Captain Random I’m not Islamic, I’m a lesbian
how does God feel about hypocrites?
news flash..your never free..your either a slave to yourself and sin(which can feel like freedom) or your a slave to righteousness and God (which there is freedom from sin and the promise of heaven)
Captain Random, sure seems like you claim God as your own, maybe if you come down from your holy pedestal and actual talk to a "liberal" youll see they come from all walks, not just athiests and anarchists. And telling some to 'shut up and listen' may not be the best starting point for that conversation
God just another form of control. Your government is also another form of control. You were born free. Think free. Freedom. True freedom = Freewill. Oh yeah and SCIENCE is real just saying. And no I'm not liberal. I don't need a label. & You all can go jump off that bridge together. I will just observe.
well then you are in for a rude awaking
Joseph Kitchens My eternal destination is to become carbon.
you can lie to yourself all you want but it won't change your eternal destination
keep telling yourself that lie and see where it gets you
Dahdog11 even more fun is to observe someone who's a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect such as yourself
Joseph Kitchens 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
not judging just stating a fact and tired of their biased media
This man is the Antithesis of being a  "Christian".
Just be thankful you have Trump instead of Hillary, else you would be collecting food stamps right now.
funny how you just generalized half the nation's population
They only care about themselves.
Albin Veselka Amen, you're preaching to the choir!!
So this was your first?
You must be stupid or a Russian troll.
Best from an uneducated president =no MBA
Tiger Uppercut, ( he’s ever HEARD )
Albin Veselka I. Think Abraham Lincoln’s address was better because you know... the Emancipation Proclamation and such.
Albin Veselka so how long have you been deaf?
As for NBC I can't say much.
oh yeah Philadelphia got Kendall on FEMA camp list
mo. ack is this still Obama’s economy? Make the case.
no they don't... when people get jobs and education... they see through the facade that they (the corrupt politicians) have worked so hard to create.
As a Canadian who watches your politics religiously it seems, I dont see why people here have a problem when Trump states how  unemployment for African American's and Hispanics are at an all time low. He never said because of him personally. Isnt he just saying he is proud of that fact? Why do some of the left leaning Americans have a problem with their leader taking prideseribg his country doing well while he is in office. Trust me, up here we could use some progress. Keep up all the good work. We all have more room for improvement but its refreshing hearing positivity. Work with your leader and if it doesn't work out show it at the ballot box for 2020. We have ours thus year and can't wait to switch thing up so both our leaders can get on the same page and rebuild our trade deals... hopefully. God bless.
djbiggyb what is your evidence of treason, please?
Andre Herring you sound like a brain dead obozo bot
Hair R US No, they don't want you and blacks and the whites people to exceed they want us all to be brainwash tool to there propaganda and that is way the Democrats were so sour that night because Trump was speaking truthfully on everything. The dems and liberals don't care about you or me all they see in a person is there vote! God bless you all
Sydney Nuñez Like the 20 trillion dollar deficit? Lol. The Growth is due to Trump not Obama. Market went up 8,000 points since he was elected.
That’s what the Desperation party does,they want minorities to remain reliant on the government.
Hair R US They make a living off of identity politics and race-baiting. They are more interested in making money than helping their people.
Trump accounted for 1% of that, whereas Obama accounted for 9%. Why clap for someone who is taking credit where credit isn’t due? And even the 1% is probably still leaking over from the Obama admin. Common sense. Or at least you’d think. Get over it. Clap for yourself if you’re so hurt by it.
Hair R US No...they want us all dependent on the government. They just proved it when all the Democrats sat on their hands the whole night sucking their tongues while being told of the IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR LIVES this administration has made and plans to make in the future. They  proved it when they refused to clap FOR America’s improvement. Because it goes against their agenda.
mo. ack Obama deserves some credit, but is job growth rate was at a snail's pace. Facts don't lie about the last year. You can hate Trump and still recognize the good he has done for the vast majority of blue collar America. To say Trump has nothing to do with it is absolute ignorance.
Low Black unemployement rates a progress that was inherited, not accomplished.
djbiggyb except the entire caucus stayed seated, how is it possible to be so arrogant that the evidence right in front of you, yet you still call it a straw man
Eric Miller please get educated, it didn’t start to decrease until 2011.
R u really black?y would u want to see your own race suffer🤔
The decrease in black unemployment started in 2011. He's taking credit for something he had nothing to do with.
Well, actually... all of Obama's success is due to George W. Bush.  (Libtard logic)
You are a dumb black man if you think trump had anything to do with black unemployment
+Sydney Nuñez Bone spurs go away.
+Peetar Ster your a moron
Gained Average exactly, he just wants someone to hate on
Yeah to give himself tax cuts. Christians are such morons.
& he’s a draft dodger. bone spurts never go away but his recent physical shows he’s in “perfect health”? so he either lied in the 70’s to avoid fighting for this country or the white house doctor lied. on top of that, he mocked a PRISONER OF WAR. someone who wouldn’t even ship out has the audacity to mock someone brave enough to.
MrHogslice wow you actually believe him 🤣 this is a man who doesn’t pay people to do jobs for him & has multiple failed & bankrupted business ventures 😭😭😭
Stepped away? No. He has visited his golf course almost every weekend, costing American taxpayers millions by the way. He often visits his home, and spends 1/3 of his time their. He is still very much attached to his riches
And im pretty sure he still has his wealth...
Thats every president
He hates his job though lol. It's written all over his face every time I see him.
Yeah Donald the draft dodging patriot..smh
Kenny Anderson an egotistical man became the most powerful man on earth for his country. rrriiiggghhhttt.
Pretty sure the six bankruptcies happened before then.
How come?
beauty!
No...
Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
MQ 786 yah also check that I’m subscribed to jimmy Fallon and plenty of other Democrats so what does that have to do with anything and im also subscribed to about 1000 channels so 😹😹🤘
Trump racist trash
Leah Gross I checked your subscriptions and noticed that your subscribed to both Logan Paul and Jake Paul... makes sense why you support Trump
If your an American I hope he wins and you will see the 2022 recession.
Z zz have you heard of a joke your on YouTube people say way worse things on here
Manu GOATbili There's always a rope, probably need to use that instead of taking everyone down with you.
Z zz It's not that deep bro
Manu GOATbili
Asteroid? So killing millions to feed your need for violence... wow Dems truly are delusional, childish and arrogant. Projecting death for your tantrums, disgusting.
Mark my words, he’s going to be impeached. Or we are all going to blow up
Leah Gross ewww
1010111111000 111, you understand that white supremacist will it make up between 1 and 2% of the US population. I voted for Trump for his policies and his stances on making the United States first.
Opie and where is it at? all I see is a bunch of white dudes with tiki torches and nazi flags
The only speeding object I see is the Trump train!!!!!
Leah Gross Where’s an Asteroid when you need one?
I meant nbc is fake news along with the clown news network and  abc (always broadcasting crap).
GTR Wendy doesn’t work when a Democrat says it
Salty libtard detected
70 % of working Americans appreciate what President Trump is doing for Our Country...js
lol
Lol
Evidence is not necessary. Feelings are the only things that counts.
Fact checkering is bad and fake news.
Pitttdog Start @00:01 & continue until he leaves the podium.
what were the lies? What is the evidence to verify they were lies?
Those lies were definitely in real-time.
My Lord!!! It's Trump Bots heaven in here.
how is it fake news ? it was live wasnt it?
Don't you you have to go dye your hair or something?
Hopefully the next generation in office is Republican because if they are democrats we can kiss some of our constitutional freedoms goodbye.
Trump 2020!
Of course today we need better overexplanations. Because...
Then you amplified the problems. As if people are disposable. There will be severe consequnces this time.
makchamp Indeed. It certainly will take awhile.
makchamp You don’t know wtf your talking about. We are currently undoing what Obama did to us for he past 8 years. We are in a race war ignited by Obama, we are trying to undo regulations that were put in by Obama, we are undoing all these unfair trade deals and agreements put in place by Obama. Look at he facts kid
All levels of all things in america.  Some of you put a label of reason why you can misbehave hidiously. It shall not occure. But under obama you were very happy and hid it. Sorry. This is not gonna play out like a large group of you think it will. These are not corrupt people. You simply think you played them like fools.
makchamp go back to your coloring books, kid
makchamp You make Lincoln roll in his grave
Did you even watch the video?
Triggered
makchamp It doesn’t sound like you are making America great again.
I like how the left drop to their knees more than a pornstar.
Just about all the news networks are biased. They have to broadcast the speech somehow, so NBC got chosen to do it. What matters isn't the opinion of the news but what Trump has to say in this speech.
Asher Peterson oh ok I don’t have my audio on atm so I can’t hear the video atm
sebastian bell I meant that the source, NBC, is very clearly biased throughout the video.
Why wouldn’t it be on trending it’s an amazing speech from the president of the United States of America and seeing that google (the owner of YouTube) is an American based company  it should be on trending
when this post was made it was when the video was 8 hours long i guess they cropped it
Kyle Strickland Da Faq? You turd.
Just a troll
What
Wtf
My man
Good! Do it again next year please.
BlueBell22 come on, turning the question on her is just sad. She stated a fact; move on.
Sydney Nuñez do you serve?
FPSGamer14 how is she hating on people she’s literally telling the truth.
"Rooshan bawt"
Me too brother, I'm proud to have Donald as my president.
Sydney Nuñez you just love to hate on people don’t you?
Rion Rich you’re proud a draft dodger is president?

ronald reagan campaign shippin in a lot a yay
meir0n 😂😂😂
Roger Pensky it seems though you are only focusing on the bad things, Winston Churchill, FDR, and Abraham Lincoln were looked down upon by many people but yet they have changed the history of the world forever. Whether or not Trump will be the next one to do that is up for debate
So true!
I would only take your prediction seriously if you could spell it.
If you don't see comments trying to help convince you of reality then it means we have given up on you.
Only Foryou stfu
Roger Pensky Bill Clinton authorized the idea of out sourcing. Why we have so much loss of jobs and why American based companies are going bankrupt and why china has become such an economic power. #sad
Ronald Reagan (please learn to spell your hero's name) raised taxes 8 times, illegally sold weapons to Iran, and started multiple coups and supported terrorists in central and south America. It's amazing how stupid Republicans and their supporters are. They are completely devoid from reality and don't know anything. They just parrot like fools what they hear their family and friends say. Zero education. #sad
meir0n opinion
meir0n how was regan good
is donald trump gonna give weapons to our enemies like regan did?
it's a very stupid prediction to make.

as you remember, nobody took seriously, everyone mocked him and regarded him as a joke.

and he won despite all odds against him.

so I ask of you to be reasonable, 3 years has remain for him to play his games, you honestly think he can't get better?

if you remember, for Clinton, took 2 years to gain momentum.

separate your emotion from the facts, and then make your prediction.
meir0n He wont even be re elected
JoLee Gigac just like you did when Obama was President? All politicians are corrupt. He hasn't done anything but divide our nation. All the things he's talking about are things done by decent people, he had no part in them and wants to take credit.
And kudos to you and your husband veronica Gonzalez for doing it the right/lawful way!
You don't have to explain yourself to them veronica Gonzalez.  They know what you meant.  They just want an excuse to whine about everything.  If they are so concerned about "The Dreamers", they should all invite them to come live in THEIR homes and support them.
Look ALL I was implying was that us American Born Citizens have Big Dreams too!!
What American Doesn’t?!!
I’m not trying to be racist not whatsoever shoot I’m married to a Mexican National BUT we did things right.
We PAID, we obtained the proper paperwork went through the proper channels and GOT my hubby is US Citizenship.
America CANNOT be expected to front the bill for everyone who wants to remain here.
Bottom line if the Dreamers want to stay here, then MAKE them pay for this privilege.
Because being here in this GREAT country is JUST that a Privilege!!
End of comment..
BriansPS3 true. The Evilness of it all. Least they truthful about there hate!!
No we're not we actually live here and always have. Dreamers on the other hand were brought here when their parents illegally crossed the border. Their own patents used them as a pawn and anchor to make their wrong a right. And on top of it once gaining citizenship used chain migration to bring their entire extended family. People who have no right to be here in the first place. Let's just forget that and forget that trump is allowing the innocent children of these criminals to stay in the country. Including their parents. I don't understand how liberals have a problem with this.
Thank you Trump!!! #MAGA

Okay Crissy.  So why don't you be the first to give up your home and all your possessions to the Native Americans then.
Honest Lad aww good one.  You got us there.  It's comedic gold!
Precisely ---> daydreamers
veronica Gonzales
Americans and DREAMERS?
Sorry but it's so sad that you call yourself American. The *real* American people are the native Americans, not you. Sorry if I've offended *anyone*
saL sageV - obvious Russian bot is obvious
veronica Gonzalez obviously you don't understand where people coming from by saying dreamers
Wanna see some very hidious stuff you wouldve never seen 20 years ago. Its repulsive and people chose it. People in positions to do so. Very repulsive stuff.
veronica Gonzalez yes!! Thank you!!
43:19 people that's what she was referring too
Opie perfection
Rich Old White Men ARE DREAMERS TOO!

Leticia Chatman he did the guy who can weld stuff
Leticia Chatman He did did you not watch the video???
Thank you
That's because they don't really know what they are hearing
you are talking about Harry Potter right?
Leticia Chatman Leticia Chatman he did say that minority unemployment is at its lowest
Also i think we need to avoid caring about color. Color doesnt matter. Only character. Anyone can be good and anyone can be bad. Anyone can be rich and anyone can be poor. Color is not relevant. The more it is brought up, the more it divides us.
Aiden Slatick doesn't sound like an American name to me. Let's deport him folks. We have another dirty foreigner in here.
the Dems were just pouting and acting like little kids. They didn't even clap for veteran health care or other benefits Trump has helped place. It was really disappointing
Leticia Chatman You obviously didn’t watch the whole speech. He honored blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Jews, whites, etc. Either you are lying on purpose or you only watched 5 minutes of it before making your false statement.
Chechi De La Rocha In What way?
Leticia, isn't signing the MLK contract while MLK's family was in the room enough?
They are all white that he is honored he really should of honored some colored that would of looked good.
Manu GOATbili So does yours
Aiden Slatick Lol You’re Profile pic makes sense on why you posted that comment
Most of them already have been.
No you ain't
Trudeau could learn a thing or two from president Trump
Ghost Purp Democrats have ruined your country just like the Liberals did to ours.They seem to have their hands on your wallet to give your money to people who do not want to get out and improve themselves. They always play the "woe is me"card  but always seem to have the best iphones , headphones and other material things.Just look at Pelosi, Schumer and Sanders.All rich people telling poorer people what they should do and think and if they don't get things their way they throw a hissy fit like spoiled brats.They are doing they same thing now as they did when Gore lost.Remember thst loser now scamming everyonebon global warming.
Terry Finn proud? You should be embarrassed! Hes making the united states look like a fool. And on top of that the man lied! I thought mexico was paying for the wall not my tax money
I just like the things he is doing,   I could use an extra 2 grand a year.
yeah the new army will be stoned most of the time, cause the whole country is going pot legal in a couple months. buy your weed at the local store etc.     That's how trudeau got elected.    so now all outsiders will look at canadians as stoners.   its a good thing but there is bad parts about it .  its a gamble ,  we will see what happens.
That’s funny how they had to make Canada’s national anthem gender neutral because it had son’s in it
Is it true that Trudeau just destroyed canadian army ? Iam hearing alot of sources talking about this , but this sounds crazy even for marxists like Trudeau , can you give some information about that ?
Hehehe. Sure, you can have him. He is brand new and works PERFECTLY. We just want Trudea please. (I think we tricked them)
Lol
I'm terribly sorry for your country. You need a real man to run the country like Jordan Peterson.
MischievousMoo All those children’s videos on your channel and your out here correcting other people? Sad life you must be living :^)
God bless Canada.
Dear* Mr.* Trump, do* Canada* time? Trudeau sucks.*
Trudeau smart but too socialist
please don’t.
The swamp will be drained and reveal a salt flat from which nothing will grow
watwud Scooby Doo An effort by who?
Look at the overall Like/ Dislike ratio and look how divided it is. Then scroll through the top comments and look how one sided they are. That doesn't strike you as odd? There is clearly an effort to keep the top comments pro-Trump.
Yeah, the swamp is being drained fr now that so many Republicans are retiring or not running for re-election with him in the Oval Office lol
lambdachi493 sure thing we will kiss our sister
Ugh
Im honestly scared of these 'South Koreans' they have fishy azz channels with 0 subs and legit no activity going on in their accounts.

네가 가지고있는 예쁜 멍청이들, 아직도 한국이라고 주장하니?
Got a feeling that some of these peeps r using google translate and thinking they're slick. No one would envy another countries president, its pretty illogical. Additionally, this was trending in America, usually if you have different location as your country in youtube, ill show different results for your specific country, and in this case, not English.
Are You on Instagram?

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Larry Vasquez, nowadays people understand comment sections are filled with trolls and bots.
Lol this guy is not a paid troll ha ha!  How much do you make per post?
Nowdays leftist believes anything positive about trump must be come from russian bot LOL.

kenvelo ™ lol, you're not South Korean
Roger Pensky Better to work hard than not work.
hope you're excited to work even harder buddy
Ruskie bots up voting their  troll's comments, that's why there is a disproportionate number of pro-Trump comments. Look at the overall Like/Dislike bar. Progressives are here, their comments are not being pushed to the top however. Because their is an effort to keep top comments as pro- Trump
IGotsMyMojo unfortunately I wish they took some time to watch it
That's because leftists are too busy crying in the streets and not working.
+10 10 I can feel the salt.. lmao

+Andre Herring No their not.

Eli, i agree.. the democrats see minorities and union members as objects they own and control, weve had enough of that and the left better recognize..
Ironic that conservatives base values are built upon consistency not change.
HI GATO CHINGA TU MADRE TU Y TRUMP CAT. GRACIAS
real change? Where? I don't see it
The original American people are black aboriginal
Daniel Schrenk Considering how much more my family is making due to his tax plan I'd say yeah. It's been benefiting us nicely.
CreativeImpactProductions It'a just another fake account don't even bother.
Did you see where they were all high fiving each other after an abortion law was approved? Disgusting to say the least
Marti Erickson sitting for every achievement was a serious miscalculation
this guy just said "no cares for the average American"... no cares? Someone please check this guys paperwork and deport him ASAP
Do you not realize the republicans behaved exactly the same way at these when Obama was president? It's always like this. the opposing party never claps.
Marti Erickson this is his first year....most of his accomplishments were under obama you can tell since trend for unemployment were already decreasing before his administration and continued to do so few months in, most if his policies doesn’t actually go into effects until later in the year. So tell me what exactly has he accomplished? Cutting education? While giving more money to the military despite having the largest budget in the entire world? Please tell me I’m curious
Wow first world problems
I liked for the president.
I was wondering the same.
Skreedge Skoodge I can promise you that there will not be a logical explanation from him
AguiPls explain. He is better than hillary.
Show the NBC that you love the President so they’ll stop crying, because it’s annoying now
Lance Clementi but Trump is garbage lol
same issue with well-shot GoPro footage of a hurricane
lol same
Lance Clementi I can definitely relate.
Oh no guess I’m a Russian bot now! ты идиот
billy j “muh Russia ties, even though there’s no evidence it’s still true”
Tucan Sam Not to mention that it was Hillary and the Democrats who were proven to have bots & paid shills. This guy is a joke.
The Russia story is fake tho u got played like a piano
billy j yes. Ve ruskies vill use ze spam bots to try to make you sink zat people who disagree with you still disagree with you.

Zis is wise investment for the mother russia!

(Translation: youre a tool, that makes no damned sense)
Bernie, is like, for the people, man
Marijuana Saves Lives Yeah I'm sure you do...
JC - Look, I'm no Democrat. Not by a long shot, but I can tell you the long faces have nothing to do with hating America. What an asinine comment to make. Democrats have government jobs in the highest offices in the country.

I will say this though; Republicans and "conservatives" are the only ones applauding a man that thought "clean coal" literally meant digging the coal out of the ground and then cleaning it. 

That same man actually had the gall to claim, in the state of the union address, that foreign car companies haven't opened manufacturing plants in the United States in decades. Wrong! Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Toyota and Hyundai have all opened plants in the United States in recent decades, previous to the Trump Administration. The only foreign plant that is set to open under the current administration is the Toyota-Mazda joint venture, and that hasn't even happened yet.

Stable genius. Very stable. Such a stable genius that when people call him out when he has mispoken FACTS, his only replies are either "wrong" or "fake news." 

You really have to reach, or just make up accusations entirely, to think that the long faces are because Democrats hate a country and people they serve while drawing a good paycheck doing it.
They are commies after all.
Now go and find a list of things the republicans didn’t clap for when OBAMA gave his speech. SMH at the hypocrisy you people blatantly put out 🤯... they agree to disagree on certain things it’s apart of life... But to come on here with this false narrative cmon JC!
Democrats did not applaud during mentions of:

African Americans doing well 
God 
The Flag 
America 
Middle Class Succeeding 
Veterans
Funny you’d promote that. Go back and look at OBAMAS SOTU speech and notice how much Republicans too HATE AMERICA‼️‼️‼️
really you judge that democrats hate america because of their attitudes when republicans are out here trying to get rid of obama care and giving the super rich tax cuts. but yeah democrats hate america.
Nah just trump
from*
Democrats are no longer the Democrats, and they have shifted to a more complex party. They are slowly turning to a form of communism. We need to reassure these folks before stupidity arises form the left.
Dixie Normis please get off your moms computer
All democrats are stupid and should commit suicide
Thucket Bucket They love the power of their position. Everything else is secondary.
JC They willingly serve america every single day so they obviously hate it. They have the power to resign you know.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/12/14/comparing-the-trump-economy-to-the-obama-economy/?utm_term=.111f56a64061

for the guy who said Obama didn't do much.

he did EVERYTHING.

Don't get me wrong, he had 8 years to do it, all i'm saying is that Trump's supporters are making bold claims that they simply can't support.
C’mon man, I don’t mind if he is but how can u be so quick to a decision. U haven’t seen any of the effects of his term, then I think it’s better to make a judgement once uve seen real results of his policies and actions, even if it’s still the same one.
EPM 101 how origional...
EPM 101 yeah what a racist bigot, trying to reduce immigrant related crime.
False, Obama didn't do much for the economy. If you look at the stats, it shows a downward trend in unemployment and that is since before Obama. I'm not saying Trump has done much more because he hasn't, but don't say that the entire economy is stable right now because of Obama because that is simply NOT fact.
jaycoin 
no it wasn't and Obama was in office during the economic crisis and the 10 year afgan war
Sydney Nuñez under Obama's entire presidency the economy was stagnant. As a black man who voted for Obama once I am disappointed. #trump2020
Greg Mclaughlin everything about this economy in 2017 & Jan 2018 is all thanks to BARACK OBAMA. look that up b/c it’s fact. i can give you a website to look at if you’re too lazy to look it up yourself?
Ur prolly 1
bax323 That is sad on so many levels. I am mind boggled that you can say that
EPM 101 for example? Or by racism do you mean African unemployment at a 45 year low
Greg Mclaughlin The racism, sexism, hypocrisy, unprofessional, deception, and narcissism that defines him.
EPM 101 why do you dislike trump
bax323 Happy first birthday!
What?
Sweetiepiepizza Yes. That would have been the least they could have done. At least theyre are some who still do.
Dragonk116 Just because republicans have the majority doesnt mean that everything is there fault (including the shutdown)
Mr_ Batsu your profile pic is an embarrassment
Have you guys not watched Obama's State of the Union addresses? the republicans did the exact same thing...
Agreed. They didn't even clap on the "bipartisan" issues. Makes them look like pouting children.
Dragonk116  a lesson in Civics 101 for you it takes 60 votes to pass a bill there are only 51 Republican representatives there for you need nine Democratic representatives to pass the bill during the last shutdown all 51 Republican Representatives voted yes tell me again how it was the Republicans fault
Dragonk116 actually republicans had a majority vote for a bill that would’ve prevented a shut down but you go ahead and keep using buzz feed as a news source.
Before the election the only reason I wanted Trump to win was to avoid having that piece of trash Hillary in office.   I didn't think he would be a great president but I figured he wouldn't destroy America like what's happening in France, Sweden, and Germany.

So far I'm very impressed at how well Trump's doing.   The media, Dems, and even a number of Republicans were throwing everything they had at him and they kept missing.  Trump is still spotless.   I remember Trump saying if he gets elected we may get bored with winning.   Well, I'm not bored of it yet but it is great to see so many things positive things in the first year under him.    

Since the opposition never seem to learn I don't think there will be much issue with Trump easily winning a 2nd term.   Tell me, are you bored of loosing yet?
Mr_ Batsu Yeah because treason and obstruction of justice is not embarrassing for Dump to do?
Dragonk116 the majority can't keep the government open.
The Democrats are so against anything President Donald J. Trump speaks. The are a shame to the party. This is America and they need to get on board with everything that was spoken. He’s putting America first and I’m 100% behind our president. I wish I was standing before the ones sitting in their seat with a look on there face of no emotion or care for bettering of this great country. I would say to them, “ you are the problem in our congress we elected, to serve us and to back the things that work for the people. Shame on you for being little babies in an adult Congress.” God bless America!!!!!
Mr_ Batsu , you are so right they look like pouting little children that didn’t get their way. Shame on them for being so selfish with the power they have to get on board with this administration and help speed up the process of making America great again. They all should be voted out of office and replaced with people who want to work for the American country that voted them into office.
Mr_ Batsu the way trump often acts is an embarrassment. The way the republicans acted under obama was an embarrassment. THEY ARE CHILDREN. when they don’t get what they want, they pout, it’s what politicians do, no matter they party
I completely agree with you, all the acomplishments they made over the year and they couldn't clap for the betterment of the American people. 3 more years to go! 7 if we're lucky ;)
They weren't paid to clap like actors.
Mr_ Batsu No they didn't. Also republicans have the house majority so the shut down was their fault, not the dems.
Jose Valdez agua de beber
I love Satomi❤️Want get to  married❤️
Jose Valdez in the 8yrs of Obama he has not quite come to term that He served the people  The people doesn't served him He always referred to himself as I Me Myself
MyDood except that there was actually evidence for that (the email scandal). Almost two years later and there’s still no proof of Russian collusion. To conflate the two is frankly dishonest.
That "NO-ONE" cares about.... kinda sounds like a parallel to the Hillary email scandal that Republicans were more than happy to spread all over the media even though it was all in the past. If that deserves an in depth investigation and fair punishment accordingly (which it does) then so does all this Russia crap.
Ashton Jaye one more thing if you  don't believe the Bible, don't waste your time investigating
Ashton Jaye that was the right question sir you should investigate! P.S I know why he calls himself that.... Find out.

j03ri every president has a speech writer.
Darrel what did he lie about? Name one, please?
It makes me happy to hear you say this. The media are the ones generating hate. We as Americans have to stand together after all we are in this together.
Phil Black, you know every Black who landed had no name, no religion or belong to a advance culture. Naturally,  If you were working for a farmer he would ask you what's your name?  You would shake your head, not knowing called by your parents in Africa. What would you call this Black man if you were the farmer meeting for the first time? Hey Boy, You Girl is not racist.  If you go to London or Belfast, people still call hey boy, hey man, hello sir, hello lady. Study history of the English Language.
It's real. Trolling is a profession nowadays.
The Democrats come dressed in hate regalia to the State of the Union. A Party that hates all that is American - why do Americans need the Democrats?  Why not have One Permanent Party under One Constitution, under One God?  Why America needs a Party full of Hate, disruptive conniving, planning, hiding, ambushing, then backstabbing the Republican who voted Trump by Americans. Why America needs the Democratic Party that's wants the only destruction? What have they achieved? A Party that vomits only hate day after day? Can anyone respond please? Thank you.
I watched it on Vice  it is like a room full of teens and each have 45-75 accounts and are paid by how many comments they get on their comments by the people who seek the info. If good these young people can make 30-50 bucks a day  and a bonus for a dirty meme  or short video they launch to get hits. Britebart  and company's like that use it and pay a certain fee for more on that same topic. I see the same trolls posting on Jazz videos, black history videos the clue was coachella  and bonaroo concert videos......thats when i knew it was  true. Viceland rocks
Ashton J Leigh IKR.. WTF 🤔
Valerie Marie I doubt the original poster is even a black man. It's just a bait comment to start a bait section for replies. They feed off of eachother. Try not to get sucked into it.
Valerie Marie THANK YOU!😎
Your post this same thing way to many times on youtube for anyone to take it seriously. All of you sponsored commenters are so telling you forget about the programs to track your comments....lol
smackyup22 You can see that the people who don't like trump or your comment let you know so hatefully, they think if you don't agree with them then you're just retarted. Dont let the few who disagree change how you stand for yourself.
Canada has a leader, we have a despot!
awwww still crying ?
