Shout out to the cameraman‚ù£Ô∏è‚ú®
I love watching these olympic level skaters do more exhibition style skates.  They aren't focusing on adding jumps and spins for the points, and you can tell they're just skating for the love of it and are totally at ease.  Evgenia looks so beautiful here.  Wonderful work capturing this moment.
Omg I love kristian 
This is amazing
Watch the shadows carefully... you can see the camera man skating when the light hits the right angles. So smooth.

This girl knows which songs to pick
Woaahhhhhhh you'rr very talented T-T woaaahhhhhhhh it's really amazing!!
I love this POV
That ice sound is so damm satisfying
Super! üëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
Her boyfriend song right? Correct me if i wrong... wow
as someone who does both modern / ballet and skating, I really want to try something like this.
Skate in a rink by myself and just.. be free.
Now this is elegance personified
I dont need more. This comes from the soul and she is perfectly into the Music. Someone like Hanyu who wins because of the jumps and technique, this is not what I want to see. I need no Music for only watching someone makes technical Highlights. I want to see someone who is able to express the music or tells a Story has an attitude and can dance and show emotions. I think they have not solve the problem till now that there a skaters who are more athlets then artists and vice versa. Everyone who jumps everything 4times will win even if she or he is not able to express the music she or he is skatig to. They are people who are artists and people who are athletes. Thats why some dance and others play football. The Rating System will always prefer those wo do all 4 fold jumps and not those wo are Artists on Ice. Dance on Ice with Partner as Solution is no Solution for the Skaters and no Solutions for public. I see Figure Skating about 50 Years. We used to see mature adult Ice Skaters no Kids. I dont want to see immature children on Ice every Season new ones.
this put me in tears i love my baby kris so much and evgenia is amazing

@L√≠a you can hear the camera person skating tho
Maria Heart you can see the shadow of a person holding the camera
I think he's on a little car or something...
Same question
XDDD
Now I have the same question
Nevermind it was a person I just saw his shadow
I think the cameras are up on the ceiling and move robotically (I hope you understand I don't know so good English)
She doesn't have any jumps here tho?
She's working on he jumps with Orser, she's going to fix it.

I think this is an exhibition not competition..
@„ÉÉNo name I think they meant doing a spin in the air? Idk
T C I just watched her do multiple spins

If you do not like her, WHY are you watching? Those who hate Evgenia are more obsessed with her than her own fans LOL
Evgenia Medvedeva FAN yeah so much ‚ù£üíïüíû
